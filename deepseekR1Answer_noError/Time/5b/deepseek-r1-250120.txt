The original code splits 2 years + 4 months into `years=2` and `months=4`, but since the PeriodType in the test excludes years, these years are discarded instead of being converted to 24 months. This is reflected in the prioritization of lines 1628 and 1629 as the top faults.\n- The test expects `28` months (2 years * 12 + 4 months), but the code only retains `4` months due to the flawed year/month split. This confirms the code does not account for PeriodType’s supported fields during normalization.'}]
