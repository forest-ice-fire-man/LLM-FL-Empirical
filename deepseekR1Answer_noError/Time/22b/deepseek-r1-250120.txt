Without a chronology or reference start/end instant, the conversion defaults to a \\"precise\\" period (e.g., treating all milliseconds as hours/minutes/seconds), which conflicts with calendar-aware period calculations. This explains why the unit test asserts zero years/months/weeks/days despite a duration that could represent calendar intervals in a specific time zone."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
