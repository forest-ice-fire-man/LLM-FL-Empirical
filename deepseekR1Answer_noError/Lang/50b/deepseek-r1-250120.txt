The code constructs the key *before* resolving `locale` to the default (line 472), causing formats with different resolved locales (e.g., `Locale.US` vs. `Locale.GERMANY`) to share the same key. This violates locale-specific formatting requirements and causes assertion failures in the test (e.g., `assertTrue(format2 != format3)`). The root cause is the **incomplete cache key construction** (lines 461â€“467), which omits the resolved locale when the input is `null`.'}]
