The forced `serializable()` call in the code snippet directly explains this failure, as it imposes serialization requirements on mocks that may not be designed for it.\n- **Line 95/97** are deprioritized but still relevant: The test case does not surface issues with extra interfaces, but the initialization logic remains fragile.\n- **Line 100** gains relevance: The interaction between `serializable()` and `returnsDeepStubsAnswerUsing` likely triggers the test\'s exception, as serialization of deep stubs requires careful configuration.'}]
