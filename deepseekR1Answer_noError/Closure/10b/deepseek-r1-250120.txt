The current implementation at line 1417 would return `false` for these cases because `allResultsMatch` requires *all* children to be strings, while the intended logic should return `true` if *any* node in the subtree could be a string. This explains why the test expects folding to occur (requires accurate string detection) but fails due to overly strict recursion logic.'}]
