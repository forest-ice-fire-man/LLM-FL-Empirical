For example, if a valid resolved function type (like String.prototype.toLowerCase) is incorrectly flagged as \'noResolvedType\', isEmptyType() would return true, suppressing property checks (e.g., indexOf). This aligns with the unit test error, where a valid method\'s property is reported as undefined due to premature \'empty\' classification."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
