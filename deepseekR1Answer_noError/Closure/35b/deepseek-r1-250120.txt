However, the logic remains incorrect for non-optional constraints (e.g., `prop1: Object` would erroneously allow `undefined`).\n2. **Line 1126**: The test case does not exercise inherited properties, but the original logic still risks missing inherited property checks.\n3. **Line 1132**: The test case does not trigger errors from the null source node, but the risk remains for other scenarios.'}]
