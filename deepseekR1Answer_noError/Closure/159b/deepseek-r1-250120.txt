The code only captures the `initialize.call` GETPROP node (not the base `initialize` NAME).\n2. The logic does not traverse the AST to resolve the identifier preceding `.call` in method-style invocations.  \nThis confirms the original fault localization, with line 779 being the most critical issue.'}]
