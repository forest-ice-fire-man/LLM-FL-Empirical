Line 741’s prototype traversal exits when `objectType` becomes `null` (if `propName` is not found), but there’s no error path for this case. Instead, line 751 returns a concatenated string even if the property was never located.\n  2. Line 756’s reset of `type` to `getJSType(n)` discards the resolved `objectType` from the prototype chain analysis, causing subsequent logic to use the original (unresolved) type of `n`, which may not reflect the missing property.\n- Line 732’s dereference chain is risky for untyped base objects (e.g., `this.c2_` in the test), leading to crashes instead of graceful error reporting.'}]
