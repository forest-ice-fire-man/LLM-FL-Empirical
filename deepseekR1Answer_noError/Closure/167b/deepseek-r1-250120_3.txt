The core issue is in line 433\'s handling of property nodes (GETPROP) as variable declarations instead of modifying the object\'s property type record.\n2. The missing undefined-type restriction in line 431 explains why the else branch in the test case isn\'t recognized as an invalid property access.\n3. The GETPROP refinement failure in line 428 prevents the type system from tracking property existence across conditional branches.'}]
