This confirms the missing logic in line 533 to handle event handler method names.\n- The test case `fold("if (f) { f.bonchange(); }", "f && f.bonchange();")` (line 570) demonstrates that non-event-handler methods (e.g., `bonchange`) are safe to fold, implying the bug is specific to methods with names like `onchange`. This further implicates line 533â€™s lack of method-name validation.'}]
