However, the original code discards the `catchNode`\'s structure in line 233 (extracting only its body) and fails to include the `CATCH` node in the TRY structure in line 234. This causes the test to fail, as the output lacks the `CATCH` node hierarchy. The root cause is the incorrect handling of the catch clauseâ€™s AST structure.'}]
