This aligns with the identified fault in line 164 (overly permissive removal condition) and line 170 (inaccurate equivalence check).\n- The missing `break` in the `RETURN` case (line 155) remains critical, as misclassification of control flows could destabilize code with mixed return/break logic.'}]
