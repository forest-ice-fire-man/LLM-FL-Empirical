The top faults (1307/1315) explain why the test might fail: in dev mode, the compiler prematurely returns `null` on errors instead of continuing with best-effort processing, breaking dependency resolution. Line 1299’s risk of NPE would directly crash dependency sorting, while line 1323’s staleInputs logic could leave inputs unsorted.'}]
