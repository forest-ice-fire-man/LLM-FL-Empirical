This happens because:\n1. The `CALL` node for `preload_check_all.call(this)` has a callee subtree (`preload_check_all.call`), which the current implementation doesn\'t fully traverse.\n2. The code only captures the immediate child (`call` from `preload_check_all.call`) as a NAME node, but fails to recognize that `call` is a method property of the `preload_check_all` object.\n\n### Required Fix:\nThe implementation needs to handle MemberExpression callees by recursively resolving the left-hand side of property accesses (e.g., in `a.b.c()`, capture `a.b.c` instead of just `a`).'}]
