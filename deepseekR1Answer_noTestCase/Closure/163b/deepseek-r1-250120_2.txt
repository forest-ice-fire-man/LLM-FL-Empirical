The error message suggests issues with method/property assignment and prototype handling (e.g., `JSCompiler_stubMethod`), which aligns more closely with improper handling of mutable references (line 668) than nullability (line 667).  \n- Emphasized encapsulation violation in line 668\'s reasoning to better reflect potential compiler optimization pitfalls (as seen in the JS compiler error\'s focus on method stubbing and tree structure discrepancies).'}]
