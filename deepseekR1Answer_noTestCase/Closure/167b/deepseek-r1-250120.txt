The root cause is **line 414**, where a single child scope is reused for both declarations. When `left` and `right` are aliases:\n1. `declareNameInScope` at line 416 sets a type for `left`.\n2. `declareNameInScope` at line 419 *overwrites* the type for `right` (same variable).\n3. The final scope contains only `restrictedRightType`, ignoring `restrictedLeftType`. This invalid type state goes undetected, causing the missing warning.\n\nThe prioritization reflects this overwrite bug as the primary issue, followed by supporting flaws in identifier equality checks and type validation.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function refines the type of a variable or property based on a boolean outcome and updates the flow scope accordingly.
