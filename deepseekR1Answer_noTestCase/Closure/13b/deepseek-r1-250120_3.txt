This strongly suggests the traversal is processing siblings in an unexpected order or missing nodes.\n2. **Line 126 as Root Cause**: Traversing `c` before capturing `next` (line 127) is the most likely culprit. If `traverse(c)` modifies the parent’s child list (e.g., reordering/removing siblings), `c.getNext()` will return a stale reference, leading to incomplete or misordered processing.\n3. **Interaction with Retraversal**: The `do-while` loop (line 135) retraverses the same node, amplifying inconsistencies if sibling references are not refreshed after AST modifications.'}]
