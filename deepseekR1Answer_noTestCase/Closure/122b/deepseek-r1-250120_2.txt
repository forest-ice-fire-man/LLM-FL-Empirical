The test failure (`testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning3`) likely involves a block comment where:\n   - An `@` annotation exists on the **first line** of a block comment (e.g., `/* @hidden */`), which the current code misses due to the `/* @` check being invalid and the `\\n * @` check requiring a preceding newline.\n   - An annotation exists in a multi-line comment but on a line not properly matched by the rigid `\\n * @` pattern (e.g., due to missing space after `*`).\n\n2. The line number discrepancy in the error reporter would cause test assertions to fail when the reported line doesn\'t match the actual location of the `@` annotation.'}]
