Strengthened reasoning for **line 134** to explain how JSDoc-related exemptions might hide valid warnings.\n3. Added explicit connection between line 122\'s parent-type check and the missing warning in non-block contexts.\n4. Maintained focus on code structure from the original snippet (no assumptions about test implementation details).'}]
