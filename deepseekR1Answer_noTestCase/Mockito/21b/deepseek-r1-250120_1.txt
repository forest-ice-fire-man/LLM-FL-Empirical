The error explicitly references inner classes and outer instance type mismatch, confirming the primary issue is using `outerClassInstance.getClass()` instead of the inner class\'s *declared* enclosing class via `cls.getEnclosingClass()`.\n2. The error message about "parameter-less constructor" is misleading - inner classes *require* an outer instance parameter. This suggests the code is failing to find the correct parameterized constructor, not that one is missing.\n3. The missing `setAccessible(true)` explains why even a correctly located constructor might fail for private inner classes.'}]
