This causes ambiguity when converting a duration (fixed milliseconds) to a period (variable-length fields like months/days), especially in time zones with DST or unusual offsets. The test\'s fixed zone expectation (64 vs. 0) suggests the default chronology used here mismatches the test\'s zone context."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
