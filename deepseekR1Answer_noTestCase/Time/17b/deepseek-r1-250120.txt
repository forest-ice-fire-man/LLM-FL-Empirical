The test failure shows the code selected a -02:00 offset when -03:00 was expected. This occurs because the ternary operator in `convertLocalToUTC` incorrectly maps `earlierOrLater=true` to `instantAfter` (which represents a post-transition reference point), when it should use `instantBefore` (pre-transition reference) to select the earlier occurrence during an overlap.'}]
