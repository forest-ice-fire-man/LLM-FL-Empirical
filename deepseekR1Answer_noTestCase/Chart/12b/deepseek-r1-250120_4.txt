This creates a fundamental mismatch between the `MultiplePiePlot`\'s dataset and the actual chart\'s data source. Additionally, the **hardcoded title** (line 151) suggests the title is not dynamically generated from the dataset, which may conflict with test assertions expecting data-driven titles. These two issues are prioritized as the most likely culprits for the `AssertionFailedError`.'}]
