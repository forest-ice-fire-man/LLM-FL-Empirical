This is the root cause of the `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\n2. **Propagation of Negative Values (Line 443)**: The negative `h[2]` (middle area height) propagates to other blocks (e.g., left/right/center), but the immediate crash occurs earlier at line 439.\n\n3. **Defensive Range Handling**: The code does not clamp values to prevent negative ranges (e.g., using `Math.max(0, ...)`). This is a systemic issue affecting multiple locations (lines 439, 443, 455, etc.).\n\n4. **Priority Ordering**: The fault localization is reordered to prioritize the line directly referenced in the stack trace (439), followed by other code locations that could produce similar errors under edge cases.'}]
