Directly references the observed error message (`IllegalArgumentException: Requires start <= end`)\n2. Explains how the code path leads to the error when the collection is empty\n3. Maintains focus exclusively on the provided code snippet (no speculation about test cases)\n4. Preserves the descending order of suspicion (only one critical issue exists in this code snippet)'}]
