The function returned `-2` instead of `9`, indicating a miscalculation in `newdiff`.\n2. The negative result implies `startValue - endValue` produced a negative value (e.g., `startValue=7`, `endValue=9` â†’ `7-9=-2`), which violates the assumption that `endValue < startValue` is always true when entering the `if` block. This happens because the check on line 436 is based on the *field value* (e.g., day-of-month) rather than the *actual date*. For example:\n   - `start` might be 2023-03-07 (day=7, month=2 [0-based]).\n   - After adjustment, `end` could be 2023-04-09 (day=9, month=3).\n   - Here, `endValue` (day=9) > `startValue` (day=7), so the `if` block is skipped, returning `0`. However, the *actual date* 2023-04-09 is later than 2023-03-07, so no correction is needed. This scenario does **not** explain the error. The error likely stems from cases where `endValue` is numerically larger than `startValue` *but the overall date is still earlier* (e.g., `start=2023-03-10`, `end=2023-02-15` after adjustment).'}]
