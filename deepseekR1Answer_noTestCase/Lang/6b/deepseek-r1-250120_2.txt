For example:\n   - If `consumed = 1` (1 code point, e.g., a surrogate pair), the loop runs once, advancing `pos` by 2 characters.  \n   - If the inner `translate` method (line 85) *already* advanced `pos` by 2, this results in `pos += 2` **again**, exceeding the input length.  \n\n2. **Interaction with `consumed` (Line 85):**  \n   The ambiguity in whether `consumed` refers to characters or code points directly impacts the loop’s correctness. The error suggests the loop logic is incompatible with surrogate pair handling.\n\n3. **Error Context:**  \n   The `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` at `input, pos` (line 95) occurs because `pos` is advanced beyond the input length due to redundant increments. This aligns with the test case `testEscapeSurrogatePairs`, which likely feeds a string with surrogate pairs.'}]
