The root cause of the test failure (incorrect column index check in line 398)\n2. Cascading errors in negative value propagation (lines 399, 416, 419)\n3. Structural flaws in basic row handling (line 413)\n\nThe failing test explicitly involves negative variables, making lines 398 and 399 the most critical suspects. The arithmetic errors in lines 416/419 compound the problem by mishandling the sign of the negative offset.'}]
