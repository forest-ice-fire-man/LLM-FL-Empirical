Added **error estimation** focus (line 284) - polynomial tests require precise error control\n3. Highlighted **interpolator cast conflict** (line 213) - Adams-Moulton would use different interpolator\n4. Added **FSAL interaction** (line 326) - common source of compounding errors in multi-evaluation methods\n5. Maintained **floating-point termination** (line 349) - critical for exact endpoint matching in polynomial tests\n\nNote: The root conflict appears to be use of a Runge-Kutta implementation where an Adams-Moulton integrator is expected (per test class name), but analysis respects the constraint to focus only on the provided code snippet.'}]
