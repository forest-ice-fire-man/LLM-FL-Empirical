The incorrect `actRed` calculation leads to an invalid acceptance ratio, causing the optimizer to terminate early with a suboptimal solution (`0.257819` instead of `0.257833`).\n2. **Line 374** exacerbates numerical instability by not using a tolerance threshold for `preRed`, amplifying rounding errors in the ratio calculation.\n3. **Line 272** introduces numerical noise in the parameter scaling phase, propagating errors into the convergence criteria (e.g., `xNorm` and `delta`).\n4. **Line 385** and **Line 339** together restrict the algorithm\'s ability to recover from poor initial steps, particularly in cases where the Jacobian is ill-conditioned (common in Minpack tests like Jennrich-Sampson).\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n1. **Line 348**: Replace `if (0.1 * cost < previousCost)` with `if (cost < previousCost)` to correctly compute the actual reduction.\n2. **Line 374**: Use a small epsilon (e.g., `preRed < 1e-12`) instead of `preRed == 0` to avoid division by near-zero values.\n3. **Line 272**: Replace `dk == 0` with a tolerance check (e.g., `dk < EPS`) to handle near-zero column norms gracefully.'}]
