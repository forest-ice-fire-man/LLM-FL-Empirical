This aligns with two primary issues:\n1. **Dimensionality Error** (Lines 181/184): When `m > n`, `wData` is forced into an m×p shape (p = n) instead of m×m. This truncates the matrix multiplication result, leaving uninitialized/incorrect values in the extra columns of U.\n2. **Numerical Stability** (Line 174): Division by small singular values amplifies rounding errors, causing inaccuracies in the computed columns of U. This matches the observed small-but-non-zero error magnitude (~1e-2).  \n\nThe dimensional mismatch is the most critical issue, as it structurally prevents U from being a valid orthogonal matrix when `m > n`.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function computes the matrix V from a singular value decomposition (SVD), utilizing cached results if available.
