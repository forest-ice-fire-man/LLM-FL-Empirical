The most likely culprit is the interaction between the `mocks.remove(injected)` (line 117) and the iteration logic. If the `mocks` set is shared across multiple injection attempts, removing a mock prematurely (line 117) could force the filter to select an incorrect candidate for subsequent fields. For example, if `candidate2`\'s mock is erroneously injected into `candidate1` first (due to filter logic), removing it here would leave no valid mock for `candidate2`, but the test failure suggests the primary issue is the **wrong mock being retained in the set and reused**, pointing to line 117. Line 116 (`|= true`) is suspicious for redundancy but less critical. Line 118 (`it.remove()`) could indirectly affect iteration order if fields are processed in an unintended sequence.'}]
