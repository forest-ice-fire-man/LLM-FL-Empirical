This suggests the name-based filtering logic in the code snippet is flawed:\n\n1. **Line 25 (`if (mocks.size() > 1)`):**  \n   The code **only filters mocks by name when there are multiple candidates**. This is incorrect because even a **single mock** should be filtered by name to avoid injecting mismatched mocks. For example, a single mock named `candidate2` would bypass the name check and be injected into a field named `candidate1` if their types match.\n\n2. **Line 31 (`return next.filterCandidate(mockNameMatches, ...)`):**  \n   If `mockNameMatches` is empty (no name matches), this propagates an empty list to downstream filters. However, the test failure suggests a mock was still injected, implying the downstream logic might not handle empty lists correctly.\n\n3. **Line 43 (`return next.filterCandidate(mocks, ...)`):**  \n   This path skips name filtering entirely when there’s only one mock, leading to potential type-based injection even when the name does not match (e.g., `candidate2` injected into `candidate1`’s field if types align).\n\n4. **Line 27 (`field.getName().equals(...)`):**  \n   While less likely, there could be edge cases in how mock names are retrieved (e.g., `mockUtil.getMockName` returning unexpected values). However, the primary issue is the flawed filtering logic in lines 25/43.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 23\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 22\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 27\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 23\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 27\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 21\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 117\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 118\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 116\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 117\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 118\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 116\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
