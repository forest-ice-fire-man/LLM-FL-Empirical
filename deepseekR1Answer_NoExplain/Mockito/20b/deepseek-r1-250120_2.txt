This suggests a spy initialization issue in the mocking framework. The most suspicious line is **34** (`classInstantiator.instantiate`), as it might fail to properly initialize the real instance for spying (bypassing the constructor). Line **28-31** (proxy type caching) could also be suspect if the generated proxy type prevents proper constructor invocation. Line **38** (assignability check) might inadvertently allow incompatible proxies. Line **35** (casting to `MockAccess`) and line **50** (error handling) are less likely but still plausible.'}]
