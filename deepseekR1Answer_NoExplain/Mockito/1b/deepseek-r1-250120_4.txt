The code unconditionally throws an exception when handling varargs methods, which likely occurs during argument capture for the `objectReturningMethod` stubbing in the test. This indicates incomplete/unsupported varargs handling.\n\n2. **Line 129** (invocation.getArgumentAt(position, Object.class)) is suspicious because:\n   - It assumes the invocation has at least `matchers.size()` arguments, which may not hold after `reset(mock)` (if the reset invalidates previously captured arguments).\n   - Type-safety issues (casting to `Object.class`) could cause unexpected behavior during argument capture.\n\n3. **Line 126** (loop condition `position < matchers.size()`) raises suspicion because:\n   - If `matchers.size()` exceeds the actual number of arguments in the invocation (e.g., due to stale stubs after `reset(mock)`), it would cause `getArgumentAt` to fail. However, the error message does not show an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, making this a secondary concern.'}]
