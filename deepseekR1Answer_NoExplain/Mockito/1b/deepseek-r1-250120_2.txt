This line intentionally throws an exception but likely indicates missing logic to handle varargs argument capturing. The unit test failure occurs when invoking a method with arguments (e.g., `mock.objectReturningMethod(200)`), which would trigger this path for varargs methods.  \n2. **Line 129** (`invocation.getArgumentAt(...)`): Could cause issues if `position` exceeds the actual number of arguments (e.g., after `reset(mock)` clears internal state). This is exacerbated by the loop in line 126 iterating over `matchers.size()`, which might not match the invocation\'s argument count post-reset.  \n3. **Line 122** (`indexOfVararg` calculation): If `invocation.getRawArguments()` is empty or improperly initialized (e.g., after `reset`), this could lead to a negative index, though the exception on line 123 masks this.  \n4. **Line 126** (Loop condition): If `matchers.size()` doesn’t align with the invocation’s actual arguments (e.g., due to stale state after `reset`), this could cause misalignment in argument capturing.  \n\nThe error stack trace explicitly points to line 123 as the failure origin, making it the most suspicious. The other lines relate to potential state mismatches after `reset()`, which aligns with the test’s focus on resetting stubbed behavior.'}]
