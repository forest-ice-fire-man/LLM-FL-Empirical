This appears to be an incomplete implementation stub for varargs handling.  \n2. **Line 122**: Calculates `indexOfVararg` but is immediately followed by the exception. If varargs argument positions are miscomputed (e.g., incorrect array length handling), this could cause downstream issues if the exception were removed.  \n3. **Line 126**: The loop over `matchers.size()` could cause argument position mismatches if the number of matchers doesnâ€™t align with the actual arguments in the `invocation`, but this is less directly tied to the observed exception.  \n\nThe unit test failure (`shouldRemoveAllStubbing`) likely occurs because the varargs code path is triggered during mock reset/argument capture, hitting the unsupported operation. The analysis focuses solely on the provided code snippet, not the test case logic.'}]
