While this is syntactically valid, it violates the intent of `hashCode()` by causing all objects to collide in hash-based collections (e.g., `HashMap`, `HashSet`), leading to severe performance degradation (effectively turning hash tables into linked lists). The method should compute a hash code that distributes values across the int range to minimize collisions.'}]
