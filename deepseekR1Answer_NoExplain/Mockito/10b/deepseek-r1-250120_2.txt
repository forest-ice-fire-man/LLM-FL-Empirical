The root cause lies in **line 71** (`newDeepStubMock(...)`), where a new mock is created without checking if the return type is serializable. This matches the error\'s reference to `ReturnsDeepStubs.newDeepStubMock` in the stack trace. Line 64 (invocation matching logic) is less suspicious but included as it handles stubbed answers, though unrelated to the serialization configuration. The test case itself is correctly requesting deep stubs, confirming the issue resides in the mock creation logic within the snippet.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 90\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 88\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 89\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 87\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 90\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 88\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 89\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Line 90 (`withSettingsUsing(returnTypeGenericMetadata)`):**  \n   The error indicates Mockito is applying serialization settings to a non-serializable type. This line likely constructs mock settings that implicitly or explicitly include `serializable()`, which triggers validation of the mock\'s serializability. This is the most suspicious line because the error directly references serialization settings.\n\n2. **Line 88 (`mockitoCore().mock(...`):**  \n   The mock creation call propagates the problematic settings. While the error stack trace points here, the root cause is the settings passed to `mock()`, making this secondary to line 90.\n\n3. **Line 89 (`returnTypeGenericMetadata.rawType()`):**  \n   If `rawType()` incorrectly resolves to a non-serializable type (e.g., `NotSerializableShouldBeMocked`), it could contribute to the error. However, this is less likely than the settings configuration.\n\nLines 87 (method signature) and the test case (excluded per instructions) are not directly related to the serialization validation logic.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 96\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 100\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 96\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 100\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
