The root cause lies in the `withSettingsUsing(returnTypeGenericMetadata)` call (line 90), which likely applies serialization settings even when the mocked type (`returnTypeGenericMetadata.rawType()` from line 89) doesn\'t implement `Serializable`. The combination of these lines triggers Mockito\'s validation for serializable mocks, leading to the exception. Line 90 is more suspicious because it controls mock settings, while line 89 simply provides the class type.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Line 99 (Primary Issue):**  \n   The error explicitly references `withSettings().serializable()`, and line 99 unconditionally applies `.serializable()` to the mock settings. This forces serialization on mocks of types like `NotSerializableShouldBeMocked` (from the test case), which do not implement `Serializable` or have a no-arg constructor. This is the root cause of the error.\n\n2. **Line 95 (Secondary Issue):**  \n   The ternary operator in line 95 determines whether `extraInterfaces` are added to the mock settings. If `hasRawExtraInterfaces()` returns `false`, it skips adding interfaces (line 97). While not directly causing the serialization error, improper handling of mock configuration here could indirectly affect deep stub behavior.\n\n3. **Line 97 (Tertiary Issue):**  \n   The `: withSettings()` branch (line 97) constructs a basic mock settings object. Though syntactically valid, this line is less suspicious than line 99 since the error is tied to serialization, not interface configuration.'}]
