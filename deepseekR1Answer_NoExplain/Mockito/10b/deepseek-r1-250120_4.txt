In the original code snippet:\n\n1. **Line 90** (`withSettingsUsing(returnTypeGenericMetadata)`) is most suspicious because this is where serialization settings might be implicitly added when using deep stubs. The `withSettingsUsing` method may be automatically enabling `serializable()` without checking if the target class meets serialization requirements.\n\n2. **Line 88** (`mockitoCore().mock(...)`) is less suspicious but relevant because it initiates the mock creation with these settings. The error stack trace points to `MockitoCore.mock` (line 88) as the entry point for validation failures.\n\nThe test case uses `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS`, which likely triggers this code path. The root cause is the automatic addition of `serializable()` in deep stub configuration (line 90) without proper checks for the target class\'s serializability.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 96\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 100\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 100\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 96\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe error occurs because the code unconditionally applies `.serializable()` to `mockSettings` (line 99), even when the mocked class (`NotSerializableShouldBeMocked`) does not implement `Serializable`. This conflicts with the test\'s requirement to create a deep stub without enforcing serialization. Line 100 (`returnsDeepStubsAnswerUsing`) is secondary because the error explicitly references the serialization setting. The ternary logic (lines 95-97) is less suspicious as the error is unrelated to interface handling.'}]
