The error explicitly references this setting as problematic for non-`Serializable` types.  \n\n2. **Line 88** (`mockitoCore().mock(...)`):  \n   The second-most suspicious line because the `mock()` method is the entry point for mock creation. If `withSettingsUsing` (line 90) injects incompatible settings (like `serializable`), the error would propagate here during mock initialization.  \n\nThe analysis focuses **exclusively** on the original code snippet, which is responsible for configuring and creating the mock. The unit test merely triggers the issue via `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS`.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 96\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 100\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 96\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe error indicates an invalid attempt to force serialization (`mockSettings.serializable()`) for a non-serializable type. The primary suspect is **line 99** where `serializable()` is unconditionally applied. This conflicts with Mockito\'s requirement that serialization settings should only be used when the mocked type actually implements `Serializable`. \n\nSecondary suspects are:\n- **Line 100**: The `returnsDeepStubsAnswerUsing` might indirectly require serialization for deep stub propagation.\n- **Lines 95-97**: The ternary logic for `extraInterfaces` might be missing a null-check or inadvertently altering settings needed for proper deep stub behavior.\n\nThe test case uses `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS`, which interacts with these settings but isn\'t directly part of the analyzed code snippet.'}]
