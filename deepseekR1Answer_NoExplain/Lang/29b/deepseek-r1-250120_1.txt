This is the most likely cause of the error since `0.0` (float) does not equal `0` (int) in strict type comparisons.  \n\n2. **Line 1673** (`return toVersionInt(...)`):  \n   If `toVersionInt` internally returns a `float` (e.g., due to incorrect type casting), it would propagate the mismatch. However, the root cause is likely the method signature on line 1672.  \n\nThe unit test (not analyzed per instructions) expects integer values, but the code snippet explicitly uses `float`, leading to the type mismatch.'}]
