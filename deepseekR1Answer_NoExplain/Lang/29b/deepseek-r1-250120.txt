The return type should likely be `int` instead of `float`.  \n2. **Line 1673** is secondary because `toVersionInt` might be returning a `float` (e.g., via implicit casting or incorrect implementation), but this depends on the logic inside `toVersionInt`, which is not fully visible in the snippet.  \n\nThe root cause is the mismatch between the method\'s return type (`float`) and the test\'s expectation of an integer value.'}]
