This is likely due to using mutable `CharSequence` types (e.g., `StringBuffer`) as map keys, which have identity-based `equals`/`hashCode` instead of value-based equality. If the `translate` method checks for a `String` "one" instead of the `StringBuffer` key stored here, the lookup fails, returning `0` instead of consuming 3 characters.  \n\n2. **Lines 61 (`shortest = _shortest`) and 62 (`longest = _longest`):**  \n   - If `_shortest`/`_longest` are not initialized correctly (e.g., remaining at `Integer.MAX_VALUE`/`0`), the `translate` method might skip processing entirely, leading to `0` consumption.  \n\n3. **Lines 53 (`if (sz < _shortest)`) and 57 (`if (sz > _longest)`):**  \n   - Logic errors here could miscalculate key lengths, causing the `translate` method to ignore valid keys (e.g., if `_longest` is too small, it won’t check for 3-character matches).  \n\nThe test case uses a `StringBuffer` key, but the `translate` method likely uses a `String` for lookups, causing the map mismatch. The root cause is line 51’s key type choice.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 76\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 76\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 77\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 70\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 75\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 72\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
