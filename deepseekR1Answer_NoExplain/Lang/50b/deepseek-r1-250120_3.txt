This causes cache collisions when the default locale changes, as the key does not account for the actual locale used. This is the root cause of the test failure.\n\n2. **Line 290**: The cache lookup uses an incomplete key (missing the resolved locale when `locale` is `null`), leading to incorrect reuse of cached instances across different default locales.\n\n3. **Line 280**: The initial key construction (based solely on `style`) is insufficient because it does not inherently account for locale or timezone variations unless explicitly added later. This design exacerbates the cache key uniqueness issue.\n\n4. **Line 293**: While setting `locale = Locale.getDefault()` is correct, the key was already constructed *before* this line, meaning the resolved locale is not reflected in the cache key. This highlights the flawed key-building sequence.\n\n5. **Line 296**: The line `SimpleDateFormat formatter = (SimpleDateFormat) DateFormat.getDateInstance(style, locale);` relies on the resolved locale, but the cache key does not include it when `locale` is `null`, causing a mismatch between the key and the actual locale used.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 465\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 462\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 471\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 478\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 466\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 471\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 479\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 465\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 478\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 475\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
