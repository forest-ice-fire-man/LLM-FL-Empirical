The root cause lies in how the `Calendar` is configured in the `format` method:\n\n1. **Line 820 (Most suspicious):**  \n   `Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);`  \n   The `Calendar` is initialized with a time zone but **not the locale** from the `FastDateFormat` instance. Week numbering rules (e.g., first day of the week, minimal days in the first week) are locale-sensitive. The Swedish locale (`sv_SE`) likely uses ISO 8601 week rules (where Jan 1, 2010, falls in week 53 of 2009), but the `Calendar` here might default to a locale-agnostic configuration, leading to incorrect week calculation.\n\n2. **Line 822:**  \n   `return applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();`  \n   The `applyRules` method depends on the `Calendar`\'s internal state. If the `Calendar` was improperly configured (due to missing locale in line 820), the formatted week number will be wrong.\n\n3. **Line 821:**  \n   `c.setTime(date);`  \n   Less likely to be the culprit, but ensuring the `date` is correctly set in the `Calendar` is essential for all calculations. However, the test date (`2010-01-01`) is unambiguous, making this line less suspicious.'}]
