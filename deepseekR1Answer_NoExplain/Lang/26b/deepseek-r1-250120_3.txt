The root cause lies in how the `Calendar` is initialized in **line 820**:  \n1. **Line 820** creates a `GregorianCalendar` with `mTimeZone` but **does not set the locale**. Swedish locale rules (ISO 8601, where week 1 starts on Monday and requires â‰¥4 days in the year) are not applied. This causes the week number to be calculated incorrectly.  \n2. **Line 822** uses `applyRules` to format the date, but the underlying `Calendar` instance lacks locale-specific configuration, propagating the error.  \n3. **Line 821** is less suspicious but included because `setTime` assumes the time zone/locale is already correct, which it is not due to line 820.  \n\nThe fix would involve initializing the `Calendar` with both the time zone **and locale** (not just the time zone) to ensure proper week calculation.'}]
