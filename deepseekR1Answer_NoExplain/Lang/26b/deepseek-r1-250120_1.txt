The root cause lies in line 820 (`Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);`), where the calendar is initialized **without a locale**. Sweden\'s locale (`sv_SE`) uses ISO 8601 week rules (week 1 starts on Monday of the week with â‰¥4 days in the year). The default `GregorianCalendar` uses JVM locale settings for week calculations, which may not match the target locale\'s rules if not explicitly set. The fix would involve initializing the calendar with the appropriate locale (passed from `FastDateFormat`\'s configuration). Line 822 (applying rules) and line 819 (locale handling in `format()`) are less likely but still related to the formatting pipeline.'}]
