The test expects proper cycle detection to avoid infinite recursion, which previously caused a `StackOverflowError`.  \n\nThe code snippet’s `isRegistered` method (line 152) uses `getRegistry().contains(new IDKey(value))` to check if an object has already been processed. The issue likely stems from **how `IDKey` handles object identity** in cyclic scenarios. If `IDKey` does not properly distinguish between object instances (e.g., using `System.identityHashCode`), the registry check may fail to detect cycles, leading to infinite recursion during reflection-based hashing. This matches the error’s root cause described in the unit test comments (lines 506-516).  \n\nNo other lines in the snippet (151-152) are relevant to cycle detection logic. The suspicion remains on line 152.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 538\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 538\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error `Expected: <null> but was: []` in `testReflectionObjectCycle` suggests the registry (likely a collection tracking object IDs to avoid infinite cycles during reflection) is not being cleaned up properly.  \n\nIn line 538:  \n- `getRegistry().remove(new IDKey(value))` attempts to remove an entry from the registry.  \n- If `IDKey` does not override `equals`/`hashCode` correctly, the `remove` operation will fail to find the existing entry (since `new IDKey(value)` creates a new object with a different reference).  \n- This leaves stale entries in the registry, causing unexpected behavior when handling cyclic object graphs.  \n\nThe test failure implies the registry is not empty when it should be, pointing to line 538 as the root cause. The unit test case confirms the code is meant to handle cycles (e.g., `a.b = b; b.a = a`), which requires proper registry cleanup to avoid infinite recursion or state corruption.'}]
