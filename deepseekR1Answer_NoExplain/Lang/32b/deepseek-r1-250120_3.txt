The key suspect is line 538 (`getRegistry().remove(new IDKey(value))`):\n\n1. **Line 538 (Most Suspicious):**  \n   - The `IDKey` is instantiated anew during removal. If `IDKey` relies on object identity (via `System.identityHashCode`) rather than value equality, this new instance might not match the existing key in the registry. This would leave cyclic references unresolved, causing unexpected registry state (e.g., stale entries or incomplete cleanup), leading to the test failure.\n\n2. **Line 537 (Secondary):**  \n   - The `unregister` method signature (`static void unregister(Object value)`) might fail to enforce thread-safety or proper synchronization if the registry is shared across threads. However, this is less directly tied to the specific cyclic reference error observed.'}]
