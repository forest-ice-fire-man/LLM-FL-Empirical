The method `isRegistered` (line 151-152) checks if an object is already in a registry to avoid reprocessing cycles. The line `getRegistry().contains(new IDKey(value))` (line 152) is highly suspicious because:\n- If `IDKey` does not uniquely identify object instances (e.g., due to incorrect equality/hashCode implementation), cyclic references will not be detected, causing infinite recursion or incorrect registry checks.\n- The unit test explicitly involves cyclic dependencies (`a.b = b; b.a = a;`), and the error implies the registry mechanism failed to break the cycle, pointing directly to the logic in line 152.  \nNo other lines in the provided snippet are relevant to cycle detection, making line 152 the primary suspect.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 538\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 538\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
