The error `𠮷[?]` instead of `𠮷[A]` indicates incorrect handling of the "A" character after the surrogate pair. The root cause lies in how the code tracks positions:\n\n1. **Line 95 (`pos += Character.charCount(...)`)**:  \n   When processing surrogate pairs, `Character.charCount` returns 2, but the loop in line 93-99 assumes `consumed` is the number of code points (not code units). This can misalign `pos` when surrogate pairs are involved, causing the "A" to be skipped or misread as an invalid character.\n\n2. **Line 85 (`translate(input, pos, out)`)**:  \n   If `translate` returns `consumed = 1` for the surrogate pair (1 code point), the loop in line 93-99 increments `pos` by 2 code units. However, `pos` is tracked as a code point index (not a code unit index), leading to misalignment in subsequent iterations.\n\n3. **Line 83 (`len = Character.codePointCount(...)`)**:  \n   Using `codePointCount` to calculate `len` assumes `pos` tracks code points, but the rest of the code mixes code point and code unit indices, causing off-by-one errors.\n\n4. **Line 87 (`Character.codePointAt(input, pos)`)**:  \n   If `pos` is misaligned (due to incorrect increments in line 95), this will read an invalid code point (e.g., the second half of a surrogate pair), leading to "?" being written instead of "A".\n\n5. **Line 93 (`for (int pt = 0; pt < consumed; pt++)`)**:  \n   This loop assumes `consumed` represents code units, but `consumed` is derived from `translate`, which likely returns code points. This mismatch exacerbates positional errors.'}]
