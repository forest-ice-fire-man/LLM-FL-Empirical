The root cause is in line 1501 (`searchChars.toCharArray()`), which naively splits Unicode code points into individual `char` values. This fails to handle surrogate pairs properly, causing false positives when broken surrogates (e.g., isolated high/low surrogates) are matched unintentionally. For example, if `searchChars` contains a valid surrogate pair (e.g., `\\uD840\\uDC01`), splitting it into a `char[]` would allow partial matches with broken surrogates in the input string. The code should instead process code points explicitly (not chars) to avoid splitting valid surrogate pairs.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1570\n    }\n  ]\n}', 'answer2': '\n\nThe analysis reveals that the code processes individual `char` values instead of Unicode code points, leading to incorrect handling of supplementary characters. The method checks each surrogate in `str` against `searchChars`, which might include surrogates from different code points. This results in returning the index of a low surrogate (L2) instead of the high surrogate (H2), causing the test failure. The most suspicious line is where the presence of each character is checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1576\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1574\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1575\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1570\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
