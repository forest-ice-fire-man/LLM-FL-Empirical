For example:\n- In the Turkish locale, `"i".toUpperCase()` becomes `"İ"` (with a dot), causing unexpected matches.\n- The test specifically checks for the `ß` (U+00DF) → `SS` conversion, which occurs in some locales but not others. The test expects `containsIgnoreCase("ß", "SS")` to return `false`, but the locale-sensitive `toUpperCase()` might return `"SS"` (depending on the JVM\'s default locale during execution).\n\nLine 1048 is the primary suspect because it uses `toUpperCase()` without locale control. Line 1045 (null check) is less likely to be the root cause but still included as a secondary possibility (though unlikely, since the test explicitly passes non-null values).'}]
