However, the registry appears to be an empty map (`{}`) instead of `null`.  \n\n1. **Line 163** (`Map<Object, Object> m = getRegistry();`) is now the most suspicious. If `getRegistry()` initializes a new empty map instead of returning `null` when no registry exists, this would explain the test failure. The registry should likely be `null` when empty, not an empty map.  \n2. **Line 164** (`return m.containsKey(value);`) is less suspicious but still relevant. If `m` is `null` (as expected by the test), this line would throw a `NullPointerException`. The fact that it doesnâ€™t crash implies `m` is non-null (but empty), reinforcing that the root cause is in line 163.  \n\nThe test failure directly points to registry lifecycle management, which is controlled by `getRegistry()` (invoked in line 163). This suggests the registry is not properly reset to `null` after use.'}]
