Characters above U+FFFF (like U+1D362) are represented as two `char` values (surrogate pairs) in Java. Each surrogate `char` (e.g., 0xD83C, 0xDF62) is > 0x7F, causing them to be individually escaped as `&#55348;&#57186;` instead of combining into a single code point `&#119650;`.\n\n2. **Line 833:** `Integer.toString(c, 10)` writes the numeric value of the individual `char` (surrogate), not the combined Unicode code point. This directly causes the incorrect `&#55348;&#57186;` output.\n\n3. **Line 827:** The loop iterates by `char` index, treating surrogate pairs as separate characters. The logic should instead detect surrogate pairs and process them as a single code point unit.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the original code\'s failure to handle surrogate pairs, which is required for correct high Unicode character escaping. The test case specifically exposes this issue with a character (U+1D362) outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).'}]
