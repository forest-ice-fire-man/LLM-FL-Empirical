This causes high Unicode characters like U+1D362 (0x1D362 = 119650) to be split into two surrogate `char` values (0xD834 and 0xDD62 in UTF-16), leading to incorrect escaping as `&#55348;&#57186;` instead of `&#119650;`.\n\n2. **Line 833 (`writer.write(Integer.toString(c, 10))`):**  \n   This line converts the individual surrogate `char` value (e.g., 0xD834 or 0xDD62) to its decimal representation instead of the full Unicode codepoint. This directly produces the incorrect output observed in the test failure.\n\n3. **Line 827 (`for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)`):**  \n   The loop iterates over `char` indices, not codepoints. It should use `i += Character.charCount(codepoint)` to handle surrogate pairs properly (but `codepoint` is not tracked in the original code).\n\n4. **Line 831 (`if (c > 0x7F)`):**  \n   The check `c > 0x7F` (127 in decimal) is irrelevant for surrogate pairs, as surrogates (0xD800-0xDFFF) are already above 0x7F. The real issue is the lack of handling for codepoints > 0xFFFF.\n\n5. **Line 829 (`String entityName = this.entityName(c)`):**  \n   While not directly causing the error, looking up an entity name for a surrogate `char` (which has no valid named entity) is unnecessary and inefficient.'}]
