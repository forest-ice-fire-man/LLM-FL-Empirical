This suggests the static set `cAvailableLocaleSet` was not initialized before being accessed. The unit test `testAvailableLocaleSet` calls `LocaleUtils.availableLocaleSet()` (which likely initializes `cAvailableLocaleSet`), but if `isAvailableLocale` is called *before* initialization (e.g., during test setup), the set remains `null`. The fault lies in line 223, where the uninitialized `cAvailableLocaleSet` is dereferenced.'}]
