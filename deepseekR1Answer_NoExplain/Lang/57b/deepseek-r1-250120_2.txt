This strongly suggests `cAvailableLocaleSet` is not properly initialized (null) when `contains()` is called.  \n2. **Line 222** is added as a secondary suspect because the method parameter `locale` could theoretically be null (though less likely given the test context). If `locale` is null and `cAvailableLocaleSet` does not permit null elements, this would also throw an NPE at line 223.  \n\nThe analysis focuses exclusively on the original code snippet. The error root cause is almost certainly an uninitialized `cAvailableLocaleSet`, making line 223 the primary failure point.'}]
