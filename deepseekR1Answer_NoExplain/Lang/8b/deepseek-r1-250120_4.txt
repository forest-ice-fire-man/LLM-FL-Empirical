Other member variables use an \'m\' prefix (mLocale, mStyle), suggesting this should likely be `mZone = timeZone`. This mismatch could lead to NullPointerExceptions if code elsewhere references `mZone`.\n\n2. **Lines 1114-1115:** While not definitively incorrect, these lines directly use the constructor parameter `timeZone` instead of the potentially intended member variable (`mZone` or `zone`). If `timeZone` is mutated elsewhere or if the member variable was meant to be used, this could cause unexpected behavior. This suspicion is secondary to the clear naming violation in line 1112.', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1114\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1115\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1112\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Lines 1114-1115 (Most suspicious):** The calls to `getTimeZoneDisplay` precompute the timezone display names (e.g., "PS" or "IC") **during construction** using the `timeZone` parameter. This is incorrect because the test expects the formatted output to dynamically reflect the `Calendar`\'s timezone (anotherZone), not the fixed timezone passed to the constructor. These lines violate the requirement for timezone names to be resolved dynamically based on the `Calendar` being formatted.\n\n2. **Line 1112:** The assignment `zone = timeZone` uses a member variable named `zone` instead of the conventional `mZone` (given `mLocale` and `mStyle`). If other parts of the code (e.g., formatting logic) mistakenly reference `mZone` (which is uninitialized), this could lead to `NullPointerException` or unintended use of a default timezone. However, this is less directly related to the test failure than the precomputed display names.'}]
