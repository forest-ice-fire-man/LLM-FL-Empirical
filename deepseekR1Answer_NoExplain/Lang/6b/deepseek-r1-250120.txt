Key issues:  \n1. **Line 94-95**: The loop iterates `consumed` times (likely code points), but `pos` might exceed `len` if `consumed` is miscalculated or surrogate pairs are split.  \n2. **Line 85**: If the `translate(...)` method returns an incorrect `consumed` value (e.g., characters instead of code points), it causes over-iteration.  \n3. **Line 89**: If `c.length` is miscalculated for surrogate pairs, `pos` could advance incorrectly.  \n4. **Line 79**: Null-check for `input` is correct but included for completeness.'}]
