If `consumed` incorrectly reflects the number of **characters** instead (e.g., 2 for a surrogate pair), the loop over-increments `pos`, leading to `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `pos` exceeds `len`. This directly matches the error in the test case.\n\n2. **Line 85** (`int consumed = translate(input, pos, out);`):  \n   - If the `translate` method returns `consumed` as the number of **characters** processed (e.g., 2 for a surrogate pair) instead of **code points**, the loop at line 94 will iterate excessively, causing `pos` to overshoot `len`.\n\n3. **Line 89** (`pos += c.length;`):  \n   - While less likely, improper handling of surrogate pairs in the "consumed == 0" branch could leave `pos` misaligned. For example, if `c.length` is incorrectly calculated for a partial surrogate pair. However, the error stack trace points to line 95, making this less suspicious than lines 94/85.'}]
