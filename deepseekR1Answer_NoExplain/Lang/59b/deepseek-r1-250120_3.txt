This directly causes the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `strLen > width`.\n\n2. **Line 880:** `ensureCapacity(size + width)` incorrectly assumes the total required capacity is `width` characters. When `strLen > width`, the actual required capacity is `size + strLen`, but the code only ensures space for `width`.\n\n3. **Line 892:** `size += width` updates the size by `width` even when `strLen` characters were written (due to truncation not being implemented). This creates a mismatch between the buffer\'s actual content and the tracked size.\n\n4. **Line 883:** The condition `if (strLen >= width)` allows truncation logic to be skipped, but there\'s no actual truncation implementation (e.g., using `Math.min(strLen, width)` in `getChars`). This enables the unsafe copy in line 884.\n\nThe root cause is the combination of insufficient capacity allocation (line 880) and copying the full string length instead of truncating to `width` (line 884). The unit test fails because "foo" (length 3) is copied into a buffer sized for 1 character.'}]
