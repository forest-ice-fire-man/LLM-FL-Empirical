This explains why `contains(\'h\')` incorrectly returns `true` after deletion (the `h` in the buffer is still present but logically removed). The loop should iterate up to `size`, not `buffer.length`.\n\n2. **Line 1672** (`char[] thisBuf = buffer;`):  \n   - While not directly faulty, assigning `thisBuf = buffer` hardcodes a dependency on the buffer array instead of the logical `size` field. This line is secondary to the loop condition but enables the bug in line 1673.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1730\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
