The root cause is in **line 1776**, where `len` is calculated as `thisBuf.length - strLen` (buffer capacity - substring length). This allows the loop to search beyond the valid data (`size = 6` in the test case), reading stale buffer contents. The correct calculation should use `size - strLen` to respect the actual data length.  \n\nOther lines of suspicion:  \n- **1778:** The loop iterates up to `len`, which is derived from the incorrect buffer length.  \n- **1772:** The check `strLen > size` is correct but indirectly relevant (passes in this test).  \n- **1762:** The `startIndex >= size` check is correct but not triggered here.  \n- **1780:** Compares characters without validating if `i + j` is within `size`, but the primary issue is the loop bounds.'}]
