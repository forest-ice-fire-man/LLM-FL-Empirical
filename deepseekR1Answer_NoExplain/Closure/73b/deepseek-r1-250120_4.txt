The root cause is in **line 1045** where characters between `0x1f` (31) and `0x7f` (127) are allowed to pass through unescaped. However, `0x7f` is a non-printable control character and should be escaped. The condition should likely exclude `0x7f` (e.g., `c < 0x7f` instead of `c <= 0x7f`).\n\nSecondary suspicions:  \n- **Line 1035**: `outputCharsetEncoder.canEncode(c)` might incorrectly allow encoding of `0x7f` in some locales.  \n- **Lines 1003/1004**: Quote-escaping logic could interfere with overall escaping if misconfigured.  \n- **Line 1018**: Comment about breaking `<!--` hints at broader escaping logic that might have edge cases.'}]
