Line 202 (`symbolStack.push(new NameContext(globalNode))`) is likely mishandling the scope/context during compilation. If `globalNode` incorrectly represents the current scope, the compiler may fail to recognize that `size` belongs to the same module, leading to unnecessary stubbing.\n\n2. **Line 201 Not Directly Related:**  \n   The private constructor (`ProcessProperties()`) is valid Java and unrelated to the JavaScript compilation error. It was initially included due to proximity to line 202 but is now deemed irrelevant.\n\n**Why No Other Lines:**  \nThe provided code snippet from the first prompt only contains 2 lines (201-202).

The code snippet from the first prompt (`enterScope` method) manages symbol scopes during compilation. Line 206 (`symbolStack.peek().scope = t.getScope()`) is highly suspicious because:\n\n1. **Incorrect Scope Assignment:** If the scope is not properly propagated when entering nested functions/modules, the compiler might fail to track the original `size` method definition, leading to erroneous stub insertion.  \n2. **Cross-Method Motion:** The test case involves moving methods across modules (`CrossModuleMethodMotionTest`). A misaligned scope stack here could break the compiler\'s understanding of method ownership.  \n3. **Symbol Resolution:** The `symbolStack.peek()` might not reflect the correct active scope when processing the `jQuery2.prototype` assignment, causing the compiler to treat `size` as a cross-module reference requiring stubs.  \n\nThe unit test discrepancy directly points to scope management logic in the provided snippet as the root cause.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 224\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 231\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 228\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 226\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 224\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 231\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 228\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 226\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 264\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 307\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 239\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 275\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 290\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 247\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 264\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 290\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 275\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 307\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 339\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 340\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 341\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 341\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 339\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 340\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 364\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 353\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 354\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 366\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 363\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 364\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 353\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 350\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 366\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 354\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error indicates the compiler is incorrectly stubbing a prototype method (`size: function() {...}`) defined in an object literal assigned to `jQuery2.prototype`. The root cause lies in `isPrototypePropertyAssign` failing to distinguish between direct prototype property assignments (e.g., `A.prototype.method = ...`) and object literal property definitions. \n\n1. **Line 364** (`Node child = n.getFirstChild().getFirstChild().getNext()`):  \n   Incorrect AST traversal logic. This line assumes a specific structure for prototype chains (e.g., `A.prototype.method`), but when processing properties in an object literal (like `jQuery2.prototype = {size: ...}`), the traversal may not correctly identify the "prototype" node, leading to false positives/negatives.\n\n2. **Line 353** (`boolean isChainedProperty = ...`):  \n   The check for `isGetProp()` on `n.getFirstChild()` assumes a chained property assignment (e.g., `A.prototype.x`), but this logic may erroneously flag object literal properties as chained assignments, allowing them to be processed as prototype properties.\n\n3. **Line 350** (`NodeUtil.isVarOrSimpleAssignLhs`):  \n   May incorrectly validate assignments in object literals as "simple" assignments, allowing their properties to be treated as prototype property assignments.\n\n4. **Line 366** (`child.getString().equals("prototype")`):  \n   Overly strict check for the "prototype" string. If the traversal in line 364 is off by one node, this check could fail for valid cases or pass for invalid ones.\n\n5. **Line 354** (`n.getFirstChild().isGetProp()`):  \n   Fails to account for nested object literals or alternative AST structures, causing missed detection of valid prototype assignments.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 391\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 389\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 388\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 389\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 386\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 388\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 391\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 398\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 439\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 441\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 422\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 426\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 441\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 440\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 439\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 422\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 426\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error indicates the compiler is incorrectly stubbing the method `size: function() { return 1; }` in the object literal assigned to `jQuery2.prototype`. The root cause is in the `case Token.ASSIGN` block (lines 433-445):\n\n1. **Line 441 (Most suspicious):**  \n   `LiteralProperty` is constructed with `key.getFirstChild()` as the value node. This is **incorrect** because the value node is actually the **second child** of the key-value pair node (e.g., `key.getFirstChild().getNext()` for `size: function() {...}`). Passing the key\'s name (first child) instead of the function (second child) causes the compiler to misidentify the method, leading to stub insertion.\n\n2. **Line 440:**  \n   The loop logic iterating over `key` nodes (key-value pairs) might misinterpret the AST structure, though this is less likely if the loop correctly iterates over `OBJECTLIT` children.\n\n3. **Line 439:**  \n   While `key.getString()` works for string keys, it could fail for non-string keys (e.g., numeric or computed properties), but this is not the case in the test.\n\n4. **Lines 422 & 426 (Less relevant but flagged earlier):**  \n   These lines handle `GETPROP` assignments (e.g., `Foo.prototype.getBar = ...`) and are less likely to impact the object literal case, but could still contain edge cases.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 518\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 520\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 521\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 519\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 519\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 520\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 521\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 518\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 522\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 581\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 583\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 581\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 582\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 627\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 631\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 630\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 629\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 628\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 627\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 668\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 668\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error shows the Closure Compiler is unexpectedly stubbing the `size` method (`JSCompiler_stubMethod`), indicating a cross-module method motion optimization gone wrong. The original code snippet (Java) appears to be part of the compiler\'s internal name tracking logic.
