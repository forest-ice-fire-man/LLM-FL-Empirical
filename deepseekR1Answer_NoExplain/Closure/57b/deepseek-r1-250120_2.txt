The root cause is **missing validation** of the argument type (`target`).  \n- **Line 197** (most suspicious): The code checks `target != null` but does **not** ensure `target` is a string literal (e.g., `Token.STRING`). This allows variables like `foo` to pass through.  \n- **Line 198**: Directly uses `target.getString()` without type validation, leading to incorrect assignment.  \n- **Line 195**: While `functionName.equals(qualifiedName)` is correct for valid calls, it could mask edge cases if `functionName` is mismatched (less likely here).  \n- **Line 193**: Checks for `GETPROP` (e.g., `goog.require`), but if this logic were incorrect, it might allow invalid calls (secondary suspicion).  \n- **Line 196**: Retrieves `target` as `callee.getNext()`, which is correct for AST navigation but depends on earlier assumptions.  \n\nThe fix would be adding a type check (e.g., `target.getType() == Token.STRING`) at line 197.'}]
