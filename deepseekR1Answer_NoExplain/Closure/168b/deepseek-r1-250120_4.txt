The error occurs in a closure (`self.bar(true)`), suggesting scoping/type-tracking issues in inner functions.  \n\n1. **Line 1996 (`if (t.getScopeDepth() <= 2)`):**  \n   This early return likely skips analysis of the closure (scope depth > 2), preventing detection of the type mismatch. This is the prime suspect.  \n\n2. **Line 2033 (qualified name handling):**  \n   If `self.bar` isn’t resolved correctly (due to unscoped qualified name logic), type-checking might be bypassed.  \n\n3. **Lines 2018/2022 (variable tracking):**  \n   Incorrect tracking of `self` across scopes could cause the type system to lose context of `self` as a `Foo` instance.  \n\n4. **Line 1993 (non-empty returns):**  \n   Less relevant to parameter types but included due to prior suspicion.  \n\nThe unit test’s missing warning strongly implicates the scope-depth check (line 1996) as the root cause.'}]
