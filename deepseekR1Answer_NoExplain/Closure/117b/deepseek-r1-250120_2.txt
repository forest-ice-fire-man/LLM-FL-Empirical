This causes the subsequent check at line 748 (`if (objectType != null)`) to fail, skipping the correct type name resolution. This is the root cause because it prevents reporting the original `objectType` (C2) when the property is missing.\n\n2. **Line 770 (`return qualifiedName`):**  \n   Falls back to returning the node\'s qualified name (e.g., `this.c2_.prop` or `C3.c2_`) instead of the intended type name (`C2`). This directly matches the error message\'s unexpected output.\n\n3. **Line 748 (`if (objectType != null)`):**  \n   Fails to handle the case where the prototype chain traversal exhausted all possibilities (`objectType == null`). This skips the logic to return the type name even when the property is missing.\n\n4. **Line 732 (`ObjectType objectType = ...`):**  \n   If `dereference()` incorrectly resolves the type of `n.getFirstChild()` (e.g., returning the instance path instead of the type `C2`), it would propagate the wrong type through subsequent logic.\n\n5. **Line 769 (`if (qualifiedName != null)`):**  \n   Prioritizes the nodeâ€™s structural path over its type name, leading to the erroneous `C3.c2_` output instead of the expected `C2` type.'}]
