The error shows `+"\\u000b1"` was folded to `1.0`, implying the vertical tab was stripped. This suggests the vertical tab is being misclassified as whitespace here, even though JavaScript\'s `\\v` is not always treated as whitespace in all contexts (especially in IE compatibility mode). This is the primary suspect.\n\n2. **Line 387 (Character.SPACE_SEPARATOR check)** - The fallback check for `Character.SPACE_SEPARATOR` might include unexpected Unicode categories, but this is less likely than the explicit `\\u000B` case.\n\n3. **Line 380 (`\\u00A0`/NBSP)** - Non-breaking spaces are sometimes treated differently in legacy browsers, but this is a lower-priority suspect.\n\n4. **Line 384 (`\\uFEFF`/BOM)** - Byte order marks could cause parsing edge cases, but less relevant to the `\\v` issue.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the code snippet\'s whitespace classification logic, as the test failure directly relates to improper handling of `\\u000B`.'}]
