The stack trace points to a failure during alias application in `AliasedTypeNode.applyAlias`, indicating the type node wasn\'t properly processed by the alias replacement mechanism. The most suspicious lines are:\n\n1. **Line 582-583**: Directly processes JSDoc type nodes but may fail to propagate aliases to type annotations. The `fixTypeNode` call might not be correctly handling alias substitution in type expressions.\n2. **Line 575**: Records alias usages for variable references but might not account for aliases used in type annotations (JSDoc), leaving type nodes unresolved.\n3. **Line 537**: The aliasVar assignment depends on a strict equality check between `lexicalVar` and `aliases.get(name)`, which could fail if the alias was registered in a different way (e.g., via nested scopes).\n4. **Line 566**: The `t.getScopeDepth() >= 2` condition might incorrectly process nested scopes where alias resolution should be disabled, leading to conflicting replacements.'}]
