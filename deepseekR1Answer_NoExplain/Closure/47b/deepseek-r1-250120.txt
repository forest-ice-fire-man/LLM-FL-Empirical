The most likely root cause is:\n\n1. **Line 141**: Rhino\'s line numbers are 1-based, but SourceMap v3 requires 0-based lines. Using `node.getLineno()` directly (without `-1`) creates an off-by-one error in the generated mappings. This explains the unexpected `C` (0-based line 2) instead of `A` (0-based line 0).\n\n2. **Line 139**: The `generator.addMapping` call might be misordered (e.g., flipped parameters), but the error pattern strongly points to line 141 as the primary issue.\n\n3. **Line 126**: A strict `node.getLineno() < 0` check could discard valid lineno=0 nodes (though Rhino uses 1-based lines, so this is less likely).\n\n4. **Line 130**: Incorrect `fixupSourceLocation` could corrupt the `sourceFile` identifier, but the error pattern focuses on position offsets, not filenames.\n\n5. **Line 132**: Missing null-check for `originalName` is unlikely to affect position encoding but included as a secondary possibility.'}]
