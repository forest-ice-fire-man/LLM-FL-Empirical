This suggests a flaw in the flow-sensitive analysis logic during the traversal, likely failing to account for mutations to the external variable `unknown` between assignments to `x`. The traversal (line 157) executes this faulty optimization pass, making it the most suspicious line. No other lines in the original snippet are directly involved in the faulty logic.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 396\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 397\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 398\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 396\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 397\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 398\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
