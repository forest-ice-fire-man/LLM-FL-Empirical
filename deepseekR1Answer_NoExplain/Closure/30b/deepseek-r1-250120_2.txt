The error shows `x` is not properly accumulating values from `unknown`, suggesting the dependency on the external/unscoped `unknown` variable is not being recorded.  \n\n1. **Line 396** (`if (n.isName() && jsScope.isDeclared(n.getString(), true))`):  \n   - This condition skips undeclared variables (like `unknown` in the test case), preventing them from being added as dependencies.  \n   - Since `unknown` is modified in the code, its mutations should invalidate `x`\'s value, but the current logic fails to track this relationship.  \n\n2. **Line 397** (`Var dep = jsScope.getVar(n.getString())`):  \n   - If `unknown` is not in `jsScope`, `dep` will be `null`, potentially causing errors when adding to `def.depends` (though not explicitly shown in the error, this is a latent risk).  \n\nThe root cause is the logic excluding undeclared variables from dependency tracking. The algorithm should account for external variables (like `unknown`) to ensure correct flow analysis.'}]
