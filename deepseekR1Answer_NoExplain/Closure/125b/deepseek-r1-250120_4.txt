The root cause lies in the over-permissive condition at line 1659 (`type.isConstructor() || type.isEmptyType() || type.isUnknownType()`), which allows non-constructor types (e.g., interfaces or invalid types) to enter the code path where `getInstanceType()` is unsafely called. The subsequent conversion to `FunctionType` (line 1660) and parameter list validation (line 1662) are also suspect as they may propagate invalid types. The `else` branch (line 1665) is less likely but included for completeness.'}]
