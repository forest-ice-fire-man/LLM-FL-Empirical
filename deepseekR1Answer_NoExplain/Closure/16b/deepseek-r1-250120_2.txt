The original code snippet\'s line 180 (`typeReference.setString(aliasName)`) is likely responsible for applying alias substitutions. If `aliasName` is not being resolved to its fully qualified name (e.g., `a.b.c.MyType` instead of `c.MyType`), the compiler would fail to recognize the type. The error message explicitly references aliasing (`goog.scope`), reinforcing that line 180\'s alias handling is the primary suspect. No other lines exist in the original snippet to analyze.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 460\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 468\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 472\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 468\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 460\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 464\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 465\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Line 468 (Most Suspect):**  \n   The error `JSC_TYPE_PARSE_ERROR. Bad type annotation. Unknown type b.c.MyType` suggests the alias resolution logic fails to fully qualify the type name. The code concatenates `aliasedNode.getQualifiedName()` with `name.substring(endIndex)`, but `aliasedNode` (from `aliasVar.getInitialValue()`) may not resolve nested aliases recursively. For example, if `c` is an alias for `b.c`, and `b` is an alias for `a.b`, the code produces `b.c.MyType` instead of the fully resolved `a.b.c.MyType`.\n\n2. **Line 460:**  \n   `int endIndex = name.indexOf(\'.\')` splits the type name at the **first** dot, which works for simple aliases (e.g., `c.MyType` → `c`), but fails if the alias itself contains dots (e.g., `a.b.c`). This could cause incorrect base name extraction when deeper aliases exist.\n\n3. **Line 464:**  \n   `String baseName = name.substring(0, endIndex)` depends on the correctness of `endIndex` from Line 460. If the splitting logic is flawed (e.g., for multi-segment aliases), `baseName` will be invalid, leading to incorrect alias lookups.\n\n4. **Line 465:**  \n   `Var aliasVar = aliases.get(baseName)` retrieves the alias based on the potentially flawed `baseName`. If `baseName` is incorrectly split (e.g., `a.b` treated as `a`), this lookup will fail, leaving the type unresolved.\n\nThe root cause is **Line 468**, where the alias resolution does not recursively resolve nested aliases (e.g., `b.c` → `a.b.c`). This results in partially resolved type names like `b.c.MyType` instead of `a.b.c.MyType`, triggering the error.'}]
