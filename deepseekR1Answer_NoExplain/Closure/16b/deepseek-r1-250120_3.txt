Bad type annotation. Unknown type b.c.MyType` indicates the compiler cannot resolve the aliased type `c.MyType` defined in the test case. This strongly suggests a problem with alias handling in the `AliasedTypeNode` constructor from the original snippet.  \n\n1. **Line 175** (`this.aliasName = aliasName;`) is the most suspicious because it stores the alias name (e.g., `c.MyType`) without resolving it to its fully qualified namespace (e.g., `a.b.c.MyType`). This would cause the compiler to fail to recognize the type during annotation checks.  \n\n2. **Line 174** (`this.typeReference = typeReference;`) is less suspicious but still relevant if `typeReference` is not properly linked to the original namespace during alias resolution.  \n\n3. **Lines 173** (parameter `aliasName`) and **172** (constructor definition) are lower priority but could involve incorrect parameter handling or scoping issues.  \n\nThe unit test confirms the error occurs when resolving the alias `c.MyType`, directly implicating the alias storage/processing logic in the original snippet.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 180\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 180\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe error `JSC_TYPE_PARSE_ERROR. Bad type annotation. Unknown type b.c.MyType` suggests a type resolution failure in the Closure Compiler. The original code snippet (line 180) sets `typeReference` to `aliasName`, but the unit test (`testIssue772`) reveals that aliases (e.g., `c.MyType`) defined via `goog.scope` may not resolve to their fully qualified names (e.g., `a.b.c.MyType`). This indicates that line 180 is likely failing to properly expand or qualify the aliased type reference, causing the compiler to reject the type annotation.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 468\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 460\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 474\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 468\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 460\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 464\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 474\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 466\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
