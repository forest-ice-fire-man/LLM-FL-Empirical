Key issues in the original code:\n\n1. **Line 358 (Primary suspect):** The `isVar` check (`parent.isVar()`) will miss function declarations inside blocks (like the test\'s `if (x)`). This prevents `recordAlias` from being called for function declarations.\n\n2. **Line 412:** Rewriting `var name = EXPR` to use `$jscomp.scope.name` might not handle function declarations properly, leaving the original function name unaliased.\n\n3. **Line 363:** The `Token.LP` check for parameters might inadvertently skip valid cases where a function declaration needs alias handling.\n\n4. **Line 418:** The error reporting branch triggers because the function declaration wasn\'t recognized as an alias due to gaps in earlier logic.\n\n5. **Line 398:** The conditional `value != null` check might skip alias generation for function declarations without explicit initializers.\n\nThe ordering reflects the most likely path where function declarations fail to trigger alias recording (line 358) and subsequent rewrite logic (line 412).'}]
