However, when `options.checkSymbols` is `false` (likely due to `--warning_level=QUIET`), this condition forces `CHECK_VARIABLES` to be disabled via a guard, overriding the user\'s explicit error setting. This is the root cause of the suppressed error.\n\n2. **Line 275 (`(warningsGuard == null || !warningsGuard.disables(...))`):**  \n   The logic here fails to account for cases where the user *enables* `CHECK_VARIABLES` (via `--jscomp_error`). The guard is incorrectly added even if the user explicitly requests the error, leading to a conflict.\n\n3. **Line 277 (`guards.add(new DiagnosticGroupWarningsGuard(...))`):**  \n   This line explicitly disables `CHECK_VARIABLES`, overriding the user\'s `--jscomp_error=undefinedVars` command. Since guards are applied in order, this later-added guard takes precedence.\n\n4. **Line 266 (`guards.add(options.getWarningsGuard())`):**  \n   The userâ€™s `--jscomp_error` settings are added to the guard list *before* the guard that disables `CHECK_VARIABLES`. If the guard order is reversed (user-defined guards last), this could resolve the conflict, but the current order causes user settings to be overridden.\n\n5. **Line 245 (`} else if (!options.checkTypes) {`):**  \n   Less likely related to this specific test failure but included as a secondary suspect due to its interaction with warning levels and diagnostic groups.'}]
