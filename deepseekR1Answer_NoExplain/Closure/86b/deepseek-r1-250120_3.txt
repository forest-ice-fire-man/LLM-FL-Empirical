Other key areas include:\n- **Line 2456**: GETPROP/GETELEM returning `locals.apply(value)` may incorrectly assume locality for property accesses on non-local objects.\n- **Line 2450**: Handling of `Token.THIS` could incorrectly classify `this` as local in certain contexts.\n- **Line 2444**: Post-increment/decrement logic might mishandle locality checks.\n- **Line 2431**: Assignment locality checks could propagate incorrect results from the right-hand side. \n\nThese are ranked based on their proximity to the test failure and code structure.'}]
