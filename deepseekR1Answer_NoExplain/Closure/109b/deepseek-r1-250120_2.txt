The test input `"function (new:?)"` suggests structural constructor syntax (`new:`), which `parseTypeName` (designed for simple type names) likely cannot handle, causing the parser to fail.\n\n2. **Line 1907 (Secondary suspicion):** The method `parseContextTypeExpression` delegates to `parseTypeName` unconditionally. This hardcoded delegation may not account for contextual type expressions like structural constructors (`new:`), which require specialized parsing logic beyond simple type names.'}]
