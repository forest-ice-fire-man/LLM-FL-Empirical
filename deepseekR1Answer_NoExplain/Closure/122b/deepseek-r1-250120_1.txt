[{'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 252\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 252\n    }\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe unit test `testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning3` passes a block comment `/* \\n *@type {number} */` (note the lack of space after `*` before `@`). The code in line 252 checks for `\\n * @` (with a space after `*`), which fails to match the test input. The condition in line 252 is overly strict about whitespace after the `*`, causing the warning to not be triggered as expected. This is the root cause of the test failure.'}]
