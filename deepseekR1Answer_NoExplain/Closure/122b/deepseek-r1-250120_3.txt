The code\'s condition `comment.getValue().indexOf("\\n * @")` checks for `\\n * @` (with a space after `*`), which fails to match the test input. This causes the warning **not** to be triggered when it should be, failing the unit test. The bug stems from an overly strict pattern match in line 252.'}]
