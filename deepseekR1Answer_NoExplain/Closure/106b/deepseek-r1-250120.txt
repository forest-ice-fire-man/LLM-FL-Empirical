In the original code, `currentInfo.documentBlock(description)` (line 192) is executed regardless of the `parseDocumentation` flag. If `parseDocumentation` is `false`, this method call may not produce a side effect (e.g., skipping JSDoc processing), causing the compiler to flag it as useless code. The `populated = true` (line 190) and `parseDocumentation` check (line 189) are secondary suspects because they control side-effect logic but do not directly address the unconditional execution of `documentBlock`. The revised order reflects that the root cause is likely the unguarded `documentBlock` call.'}]
