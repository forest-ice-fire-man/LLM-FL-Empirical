This line uses `toString()` instead of propagating the `forAnnotations` flag to nested types. Recursive properties would call `toString()` instead of `toStringHelper(forAnnotations)`, causing `{...}` instead of `?` in annotations.\n\n2. **Line 394 (`return "{...}"`):**  \n   The `else` block returns `{...}` regardless of the `forAnnotations` flag. When `forAnnotations=true` (e.g., in `toAnnotationString()`), it should return `?` instead to match the test expectation.\n\n3. **Line 358 (`prettyPrint = false`):**  \n   Temporarily disabling `prettyPrint` might inadvertently affect nested `toString()` calls, preventing proper recursion detection in annotation mode. However, this is less likely than the above two issues.\n\n4. **Line 364 (`propertyNames.size() <= MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES`):**  \n   If the loop exits early due to property count limits, truncated output might cause unexpected behavior. However, the test error is specific to recursion, not truncation.\n\n5. **Line 385 (`sb.append(", ...")`):**  \n   Appending `...` on truncation might conflict with recursive annotations, but the test error does not directly suggest this. Lower suspicion.'}]
