Wait, the order should be descending suspicion. The first entry is most suspicious.\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but according to the analysis, the most critical is line 358, then 364, then 383. So:\n\n[\n  { "lineNumber": 358 },\n  { "lineNumber": 364 },\n  { "lineNumber": 383 }\n]\n\nBut the user allows up to five entries. Are there more possible lines?\n\nAnother possible line: line 391. If the code exits early (like a return or exception) before line 391, prettyPrint remains false. But the main issue is line 358\'s assignment without a try-finally. So line 358 is the primary suspect.\n\nAnother line to consider: line 367, where propertyNames.addAll(current.getOwnPropertyNames()) is called. If current.getOwnPropertyNames() returns a large collection, it could cause propertyNames to exceed MAX. But the root cause is the loop condition on line 364 allowing that. So line 364 is the main issue.\n\nAnother thing: in line 391, prettyPrint is set back to true. But if there\'s a concurrent modification, but thread-safety isn\'t considered here. So likely not included.\n\nThus, the JSON should list 358, 364, 383 in order.\n\nBut the user\'s example includes line numbers as integers. So:\n\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    { "lineNumber": 358 },\n    { "lineNumber": 364 },\n    { "lineNumber": 383 }\n  ]\n}\n\nBut the code given in the problem has line 383 as:\n\n383:if (i == MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES) {\n\nYes. So the final answer would be these three lines in order of suspicion.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    { "lineNumber": 358 },\n    { "lineNumber": 364 },\n    { "lineNumber": 383 }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    { "lineNumber": 394 },\n    { "lineNumber": 358 },\n    { "lineNumber": 354 },\n    { "lineNumber": 364 },\n    { "lineNumber": 383 }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
