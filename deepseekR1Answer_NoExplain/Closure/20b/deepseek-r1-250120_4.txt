This line only checks if the first argument exists but fails to verify there are **no additional arguments**. This allows the faulty transformation to proceed when there are extra arguments, violating the intended semantics.\n\n2. **Line 219** (`Node value = callTarget.getNext()`): This retrieves the first argument but does not check if there are subsequent arguments. Combined with line 220’s insufficient check, it leads to ignoring extra arguments like `bar()` in the test case.\n\n3. **Line 221** (`Node addition = IR.add(...)`): Proceeds to create an `ADD` node even when there are extra arguments, resulting in incorrect code (`"" + "hello"` instead of preserving the extra argument).\n\n4. **Line 211** (`if (callTarget != null && callTarget.isName() && callTarget.getString().equals("String"))`): While correct in identifying `String` calls, it does not account for the function’s arity (number of arguments), which is critical for safe substitution. This is a secondary issue but relevant to the root cause.'}]
