The root cause is in **line 220** where the code checks `if (value != null)` but fails to verify there are **no additional arguments** beyond the first one. This allows the transformation to proceed even when multiple arguments exist. The check should also ensure `value.getNext() == null`.  \n\n**Line 221** (creating the `ADD` node) and **line 224** (replacing the original node) are secondary suspects because they execute the faulty transformation. **Line 213** (the comment about "immutable literals") is less suspicious but included because the logic may misunderstand `String()`\'s semantics when arguments are non-literal.'}]
