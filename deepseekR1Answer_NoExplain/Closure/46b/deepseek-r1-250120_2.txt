This line is the root cause: the logic to compute the least supertype for record types is fundamentally flawed here.\n\n2. **Line 146 (`for (String property : properties.keySet())`):**  \n   The loop iterates **only over the properties of `this` record**, ignoring properties unique to `that` record. This causes the merged type to lose properties from `that` (e.g., `c` and `e` in the test case).\n\n3. **Line 147 (`if (that.toMaybeRecordType().hasProperty(property)...`):**  \n   The conditional logic is overly restrictive. It requires *both* records to share a property **and** have equivalent types for that property. This discards properties that exist in either record but not both (violating the union requirement).\n\n4. **Line 142 (`if (!that.isRecordType())`):**  \n   The guard clause delegates to `super.getLeastSupertype(that)` only when `that` is not a record type. However, when both `this` and `that` are records, the current logic fails to handle the union case, suggesting an incorrect assumption about record-type compatibility.\n\n5. **Line 150 (`builder.addProperty(...)`):**  \n   Even if the logic were corrected to include properties from both records, this line would still need to reconcile conflicting property types (e.g., via union) instead of blindly taking `this` type.'}]
