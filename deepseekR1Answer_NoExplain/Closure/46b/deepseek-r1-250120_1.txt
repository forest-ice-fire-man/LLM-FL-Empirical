This causes the result to be an *intersection* (`{b: string}`) instead of a *union* of both records\' properties. The least supertype should include all properties from both records, not just shared ones.\n\n2. **Lines 147-149**: The check `isEquivalentTo` is overly strict. It requires property types to be *equivalent* rather than computing their *least supertype*. For example, if `this` has `number` and `that` has `?number`, the code would incorrectly skip the property even though they are compatible.\n\n3. **Line 142**: The fallback to `super.getLeastSupertype(that)` when `that` is not a record type might be correct, but the test failure suggests the current logic for record-type handling is flawed, making this line a lower-priority suspect.'}]
