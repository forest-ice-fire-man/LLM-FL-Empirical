A missing provide for `namespace.Class1` (handled in line 301-303)  \n2. An undeclared `goog` variable (likely caused by line 329-330 not removing the `goog.require` call when validation fails).  \n\n**Key findings:**  \n1. **Line 329** is the top suspect because the `if (provided != null)` guard prevents node removal when validation fails (leaving `goog.require` in the AST, causing the "undeclared goog" error).  \n2. **Line 301** fails to enforce node removal when a provide is invalid/missing.  \n3. **Line 330** (detach logic) is conditional on the problematic guard in line 329.  \n4. **Line 300** retrieves the namespace but doesn\'t handle missing provides aggressively enough.  \n5. **Line 308** could fail if `providedModule` is null despite earlier checks, but this is less likely given the test failure context.'}]
