This suggests a flaw in how properties are registered. If `defineDeclaredProperty` does not correctly associate the property name with its type information, the type checker will not recognize missing properties. For example, if `prop.getType()` returns an incorrect type or the property node is not properly linked, type validation would fail silently.\n\n2. **Line 84 (`super(registry, null, null)`):**  \n   The `null` arguments for the parent constructor (likely `JSType` or similar) may prevent proper inheritance of type constraints. If the second `null` represents a "template type" (e.g., a base record type), omitting it could disable property inheritance checks, causing the compiler to miss undefined properties like `name2`.\n\n3. **Line 89 (`if (prop == null)`):**  \n   While less likely, this null-check could mask deeper issues if `properties` contains keys mapped to `null` due to initialization errors, but the test case does not directly suggest this scenario. Lower suspicion compared to the above lines.\n\nThe analysis focuses **exclusively on the original code snippet** and its interaction with the type system, as required. The test case and error message highlight missing type validation, pointing to flaws in property registration (line 93) and type initialization (line 84).'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 88\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 88\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 87\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 91\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 85\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
