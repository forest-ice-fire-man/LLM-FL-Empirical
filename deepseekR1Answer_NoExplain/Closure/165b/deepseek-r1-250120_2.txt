This suggests the type checker is not properly validating record properties.  \n\n1. **Line 94**: The call to `defineDeclaredProperty` might not correctly register the property in the type system. If the property is not tracked, the type checker cannot detect invalid accesses like `rec.name2`.  \n2. **Line 84**: The `super(registry, null, null)` call passes `null` for critical parent type parameters, which might prevent proper inheritance or property resolution.  \n3. **Line 98**: Freezing the record type (`isFrozen = true`) after property definition could interfere with type-checking logic if not handled correctly.  \n\nThe analysis focuses on the original code snippet\'s interaction with the type registry and property validation, as required.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 88\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 87\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 92\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 88\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 87\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 92\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
