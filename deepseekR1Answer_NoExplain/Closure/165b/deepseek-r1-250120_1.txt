If the superclass expects these parameters to enforce a sealed record type, passing `null` might leave the type unsealed, allowing unexpected properties (e.g., `name2` in the test case) to go undetected. This matches the test failure where no warning is thrown for an undefined property.\n\n2. **Line 93 (`defineDeclaredProperty(...)`):**  \n   If `defineDeclaredProperty` fails to register properties in the type registry (e.g., due to incorrect parameters like `prop.getType()` or `prop.getPropertyNode()`), the type checker would not recognize `name` as a valid property of `RecordType1`, leading to silent failures. However, the test specifically expects a missing `name2` warning, making this less likely than line 84.\n\n3. **Line 98 (`isFrozen = true`):**  \n   Freezing the type after defining properties should enforce sealing. If the `isFrozen` flag is not respected by the type checker, extra properties like `name2` might still be allowed. However, this is less likely than an initialization error in line 84.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 87\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 91\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 87\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 88\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 91\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error in the unit test (`Property name2 never defined on rec`) indicates the type checker failed to detect an invalid property access. The test defines `RecordType1` with property `name`, but the code tries to access `name2`. The most suspicious code is:\n\n1. **Line 87 (`if (isEmpty)`):** Returning `OBJECT_TYPE` (a generic type) when the record is empty may suppress property validation. If `isEmpty` is erroneously `true` for non-empty records, the type checker would allow any property access (like `name2`) on the generic object type, explaining the missing warning.\n\n2. **Line 88 (`return registry.getNativeObjectType...`):** Returning `OBJECT_TYPE` instead of an explicit empty record type might disable strict property checks. This aligns with the test failure where an invalid property access went undetected.\n\n3. **Line 91 (`new RecordType(...)`):** If the `properties` map passed to `RecordType` is incorrectly constructed (e.g., missing type constraints), it could allow invalid properties. However, this is less likely given the test’s focus on empty vs. non-empty records.\n\nThe test suggests the core issue lies in how empty records are handled, making lines 87–88 the primary suspects.'}]
