Assignments in function call arguments (like `a.push(b = [])`) should be considered aliased because `b` escapes into the array (`a`), but `isExprResult()` might return false in this context, leading to a false `maybeAliased = false`.\n\n2. **Line 906:**  \n   `maybeAliased ||`  \n   If `maybeAliased` is incorrectly false (due to line 904), this condition fails to account for secondary side effects, causing unsafe removal.\n\n3. **Line 905:**  \n   `this.mayHaveSecondarySideEffects =`  \n   The entire side-effect detection logic depends on accurate `maybeAliased` (line 904). If `b = []` is considered side-effect-free, the assignment is removed prematurely.\n\n4. **Lines 907-908:**  \n   `NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects(...)` checks might fail to detect that `b = []` creates a reference used later (`b[0] = 1`). This is secondary to the root cause in line 904.\n\nThe error stems from line 904â€™s parent-check logic, which incorrectly marks the assignment as non-aliased, cascading into incorrect side-effect analysis.'}]
