The error indicates the compiler allowed collapsing when it should not have preserved reference semantics between `a.b` and `c.b`.\n\n1. **Line 920** (`if (type != Type.FUNCTION && aliasingGets > 0)`):  \n   - This guard skips the aliasing check **for functions**, allowing collapsing even when aliasing occurs. The test case involves a function (`a`) with an alias (`c`), so this condition fails to block collapsing for `FUNCTION` types with aliasing.  \n   - **Fix:** Remove the `type != Type.FUNCTION` check to enforce aliasing restrictions for functions.\n\n2. **Line 897** (`globalSets != 1 || localSets != 0`):  \n   - The test case has one global write (`a.b = 1`) and no local writes. If `globalSets`/`localSets` tracking is inaccurate (e.g., missing `c.b = 2` as a global write), this condition might incorrectly allow collapsing.  \n   - **Secondary suspicion:** Verify metric calculation for `globalSets`.'}]
