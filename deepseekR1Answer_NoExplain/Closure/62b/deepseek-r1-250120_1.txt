This is controlled by the logic in lines 95-108.  \n\n1. **Line 98** (Most suspicious): The condition `charno < sourceExcerpt.length()` excludes the case where `charno == sourceExcerpt.length()` (as noted in the comment on line 95). This prevents the caret from being added when the error is at the end of the line. The condition should use `<=` instead of `<`.  \n\n2. **Line 97**: The check `excerpt.equals(LINE)` might incorrectly restrict the caret logic to line-level excerpts, but the test case suggests this is the intended behavior. Still, a mismatch here could contribute to the issue.  \n\n3. **Line 95**: The comment explicitly describes the edge case (`charno == sourceExcerpt.length()`), but the code fails to handle it due to the condition in line 98.  \n\n4. **Line 99**: The loop `for (int i = 0; i < charno; i++)` could misalign whitespace padding if `charno` exceeds valid indices, but this is secondary to the condition in line 98.  \n\n5. **Line 70**: If `sourceExcerpt` is not extracted correctly (e.g., missing trailing space), the padding logic would fail. However, the test output shows the source line is present, making this less likely.'}]
