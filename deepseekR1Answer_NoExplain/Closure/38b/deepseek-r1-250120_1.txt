This happens because `x < 0` is **false** for `-0.0` (since `-0.0 == 0.0` numerically), so the space is never added. The condition should check `negativeZero` in addition to `x < 0`.\n\n2. **Line 244** (`boolean negativeZero = isNegativeZero(x);`):  \n   If `isNegativeZero(x)` incorrectly identifies `-0.0` (e.g., due to floating-point comparison issues), the subsequent logic for handling negative zero would fail. This line is secondary to line 245 but critical for ensuring `negativeZero` is accurately detected.\n\n3. **Line 249** (`if ((long) x == x && !negativeZero)`):  \n   This skips scientific notation for integers but explicitly excludes negative zero. If `negativeZero` is mishandled here, it might incorrectly format `-0.0` (though the test failure suggests the primary issue is space insertion, not formatting).\n\n4. **Line 265** (`add(String.valueOf(x))`):  \n   For `-0.0`, `String.valueOf(x)` produces `-0.0`, which is correct. However, if the preceding space logic (line 245) fails, this line will still output the unspaced `-0.0`, contributing to the error.\n\n5. **Line 259** (`if (exp > 2)`):  \n   Unrelated to the test failure but could cause issues in scientific notation edge cases (low suspicion).'}]
