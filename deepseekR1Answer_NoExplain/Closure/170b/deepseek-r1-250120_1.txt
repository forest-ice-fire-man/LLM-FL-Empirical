The logic in lines 488-489 (`parent.isAssign() && parent.getFirstChild() == n`) correctly excludes writes (LHS of assignments) but may over-exclude valid reads in complex expressions like the hook. The test case shows the read `i` in the comma operator is not counted, leading to incorrect inlining. The condition in lines 488-489 is the most suspicious because it governs exclusion of LHS assignments, but contextual constraints (e.g., assignments inside hooks) may not be handled properly. Line 486 (the `TODO` comment) also highlights known imprecision in side-effect checks, reinforcing suspicion around this logic.'}]
