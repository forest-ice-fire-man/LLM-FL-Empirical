The unit test involves object literal getters (e.g., `get name0(){...}`), which are function expressions. The current implementation of `isReduceableFunctionExpression` (line 117) naively checks if the node is a function expression via `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)`, but this may fail to account for edge cases like:  \n- **Object literal getter/setter methods**, which are function expressions but might require additional validation in the compiler\'s function rewriter logic.  \n- **Free calls** (indicated in the stack trace) that might be misclassified as reducible function expressions.  \n\nThe root cause likely lies in line 117 not properly validating the context of the function expression (e.g., ensuring itâ€™s not part of a call or getter/setter declaration). The error stack trace specifically points to `validateObjectLitGetKey`, reinforcing that the issue relates to object literal getters.'}]
