The test case uses object literal getters (e.g., `get name0(){...}`), which define function expressions. The method `isReduceableFunctionExpression` (line 117) returns `true` for any function expression via `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)`, but in this context, some function expressions (like getters/setters) might require special handling to avoid being transformed into calls during optimization. The line `117` is suspicious because it unconditionally marks function expressions as reducible without considering their specific context (e.g., object literal methods that cannot be safely reduced).'}]
