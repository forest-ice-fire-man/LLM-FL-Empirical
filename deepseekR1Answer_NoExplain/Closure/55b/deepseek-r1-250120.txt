The unit test involves object literal getters (e.g., `get name0(){...}`), which are function expressions. The method `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)` (line 117) returns `true` for these getters, but their enclosing context (object literal properties) may require stricter validation. The root cause is line 117\'s overly permissive check, which allows function expressions in invalid contexts (e.g., when they are part of a call or object method). Line 116 is less suspicious but still flagged as it defines the method boundary.'}]
