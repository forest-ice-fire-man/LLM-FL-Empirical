The code snippet handles type equality checks and type restriction propagation. Key suspicions:\n\n1. **Line 295 (`merged = merging.apply(...)`):**  \n   The merged type pair might not properly propagate type restrictions to detect undefined properties. If the merging function fails to preserve or enforce type constraints, the subsequent scope restriction (lines 301-302) would be incorrect.\n\n2. **Lines 301-302 (`maybeRestrictTwoNames`):**  \n   These lines apply the merged types to the scope. If the type refinement logic here does not properly restrict the type of `left`/`right`, the compiler might retain overly broad type information, missing the undefined property warning.\n\n3. **Lines 281/291 (`leftType = left.getJSType()` / `rightType = right.getJSType()`):**  \n   If `getJSType()` returns an overly permissive type (e.g., `unknown` or a supertype), the merging process would fail to detect that `unknownProp` is undefined on the concrete type `Type`.\n\nThe ordering reflects the likelihood of these lines contributing to the missing warning, with line 295 (type merging) being the most critical suspect.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 330\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 337\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 338\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 341\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 325\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 394\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 395\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 396\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 397\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 399\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 416\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 419\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 414\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 410\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 412\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 416\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 419\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 414\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 410\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 412\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe test failure indicates the type checker failed to detect that `me.unknownProp` is not a defined property of `Type`. This suggests a flaw in type refinement propagation. The most suspicious lines are:\n\n1. **Lines 416 & 419 (`declareNameInScope` calls):** If these fail to properly bind the refined types (`restrictedLeftType`/`restrictedRightType`) to variables `left`/`right` in the scope, the type system would not know to enforce properties like `unknownProp` on the refined type.\n\n2. **Line 414 (`createChildFlowScope`):** If the child scope is not correctly inheriting or merging type information from `blindScope`, type refinements might be lost.\n\n3. **Lines 410 & 412 (refinement conditions):** If the logic determining `shouldRefineLeft`/`shouldRefineRight` incorrectly skips refinement (e.g., due to unexpected `null` values), required type information would not be propagated. \n\nThe analysis focuses on the original code snippet’s ability to propagate type restrictions, which directly impacts the test case’s missing warning.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 433\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 431\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 429\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 434\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 428\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 431\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 433\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 428\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 429\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 434\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
