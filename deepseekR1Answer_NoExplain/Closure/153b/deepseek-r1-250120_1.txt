This stems from the logic in lines 671-677 and 678-681, which convert VAR declarations to assignments even when the original declaration is in externs (which should be allowed per comments in lines 643-646). The most suspicious line is **678** (parent type VAR check), as it unconditionally triggers replacement without verifying if the original `Var` came from externs. The replacement logic in **675** and the lack of externs-related conditions in **648** are also highly suspect. Earlier line numbers are prioritized as they control the main redeclaration handling flow.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 94\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 102\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 93\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 103\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 94\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 95\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 103\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 93\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 102\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe test failure indicates a mismatch between expected `VAR` declaration and actual `ASSIGN` (expression statement). The code snippet\'s line 94-95 is likely declaring the function name variable `extern` even when it should respect the externs declaration. This occurs because:  \n1. **Line 94** (`if (!fnName.isEmpty() && NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n))`) lacks a check to verify if `fnName` is already declared in the outer scope (including externs), leading to duplicate declarations.  \n2. **Line 95** (`declareVar(...)`) then creates a new variable declaration instead of reusing the extern declaration, causing normalization to produce an assignment instead of a `VAR` node.  \n3. **Line 103** (parameter declarations) could also conflict with externs if parameters share names with extern variables, though less likely in this specific test case.  \n\nThe updated ordering prioritizes the missing scope check (line 94) and subsequent declaration (line 95) as the primary suspects.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 154\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 147\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 170\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 160\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 142\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 127\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 142\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 154\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 160\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 147\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {}, {}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 219\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 204\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 205\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 195\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 240\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 240\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 239\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 244\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 241\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Line 240 (Most Suspicious):**  \n   The condition `name.equals(ARGUMENTS)` appears overly restrictive. The test failure involves a duplicate `extern` variable in externs, but this line only handles duplicates for the special `arguments` variable in local scopes. This would prevent proper handling of other variables (like `extern`) in externs scope, leading to incorrect AST structures (assignment instead of `VAR` declaration).\n\n2. **Line 239:**  \n   The `scope.isDeclared(name, false)` check might not account for externs scope declarations properly, failing to detect duplicates in externs context.\n\n3. **Line 244:**  \n   The `scope.declare(...)` call could be incorrectly allowing redeclarations in externs scope when it should instead trigger an error or normalization.\n\n4. **Line 241:**  \n   The `redeclarationHandler.onRedeclaration(...)` might not be handling externs scope normalization appropriately (e.g., not converting assignments to `VAR` nodes when `@suppress {duplicate}` is present).'}]
