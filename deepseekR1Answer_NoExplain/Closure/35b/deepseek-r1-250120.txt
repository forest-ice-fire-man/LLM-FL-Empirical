This incorrectly forces optionality on the property, causing the type system to accept `{prop2: number}` (via `void|Object`) as compatible with `{prop1: (Object|undefined)}`, leading to the unexpected union type in the error.\n\n2. **Line 1132**: Defining the inferred property (`objType.defineInferredProperty`) when the object structurally lacks it creates a mismatch between the inferred type (which includes the property) and the actual runtime object (which does not), causing spurious structural compatibility.\n\n3. **Line 1128**: The check `!objType.hasProperty(prop)` detects missing properties, but the subsequent logic (lines 1130–1132) handles this incorrectly by adding the property instead of enforcing its absence.\n\n4. **Line 1126**: The check `!objType.isPropertyTypeDeclared(prop)` might fail to account for implicit structural mismatches (e.g., missing properties in some code paths), leading to over-aggressive inference.\n\n5. **Line 1124**: Iterating over `constraintObj.getOwnPropertyNames()` assumes the constraint’s properties must exist on the object, but this may force invalid inferences when properties are intentionally absent in some branches (as in the test case).'}]
