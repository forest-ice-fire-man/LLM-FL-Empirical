This line handles `@interface` annotations by creating a *function type* (constructor) rather than an *instance type*. This would incorrectly type the object literal as the interface constructor instead of its instance.\n\n2. **Line 1270:** The `@type {TwoNumbers}` annotation should dominate type resolution, but if `getDeclaredTypeInAnnotation` fails to resolve interface instance types correctly (e.g., returns the interface constructor instead of instance), it would cause the mismatch observed.\n\n3. **Line 1280:** The fallback to `createEnumTypeFromNodes` could interfere if the `@const` declaration is misclassified as an enum, but the test case doesn\'t use enums.\n\n4. **Line 1316:** The final fallback to `getDeclaredTypeInAnnotation` might inherit the same interface/constructor confusion as line 1270.\n\n5. **Line 1295:** While less likely, this line returns `rValue.getJSType()` directly. If type-casting annotations are misapplied, it could propagate incorrect types.'}]
