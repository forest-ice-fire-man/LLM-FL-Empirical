This points to a dependency scope misassociation in non-loop assignments.  \n\n1. **Line 585** (`recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);`) is the primary suspect. The comment indicates this path handles assignments where the right-hand side (rhs) is the "caller" (e.g., the function expression). Using `recordNode` (the rhs) instead of `nameNode` (the lhs) may incorrectly associate `x` with the function\'s scope instead of the outer scope where `x` is declared.  \n\n2. **Line 573** (loop position check) and **Line 576** (loop iteration part handling) are secondary suspects, as the original analysis flagged this area for dependency scope conflicts.  \n\n3. **Line 574** and **Line 563** (loop condition checks) are lower-priority suspects but relate to the broader dependency scope logic.  \n\nThe test case does not involve a loop, so the error likely stems from line 585â€™s non-loop logic.'}]
