The code snippet\'s logic at line 405 (`(leftType.isConstructor() || leftType.isEnumType()) && (...)`) incorrectly allows an enum-to-constructor redefinition to bypass the `mismatch(...)` call (line 408), which is likely responsible for generating one of the two expected warnings. The `registerMismatch` (line 406) might not emit a warning in this context, causing the undercount. Line 405\'s condition is overly permissive for this edge case, and line 406 fails to trigger the required warning. Line 408 (the `else` branch) and the guard condition at line 404 are also implicated in the control flow leading to the missing warning.'}]
