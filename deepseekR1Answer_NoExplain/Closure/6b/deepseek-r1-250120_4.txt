The code snippet handles enum/constructor mismatches in a special way at **line 405** (suppressing the standard `mismatch` warning in favor of `registerMismatch` at line 406). This likely causes one expected warning to be missed. The standard `mismatch` call at **line 408** would generate a type-mismatch warning, but the special-case logic bypasses it. The root cause is likely in the condition at **line 405** being overly broad or incorrect for this scenario.'}]
