The most suspicious code is in dependency management:\n\n1. **Line 1299**: The ternary `moduleGraph == null ? new JSModuleGraph(modules) : moduleGraph` suggests potential module graph initialization issues. If `modules` aren\'t properly populated when creating a new graph, dependency sorting may fail.\n\n2. **Line 1289**: The loop over `inputs` to forward-declare types **before sorting** could create false assumptions about declaration order if inputs aren\'t yet properly ordered by dependencies.\n\n3. **Line 1300**: The `manageDependencies` call might not handle self-referential dependencies correctly (a `require` before its corresponding `provide`), especially if the dependency graph doesn\'t enforce strict provide-before-require ordering.\n\n4. **Line 1323**: `repartitionInputs()` after stale inputs might inadvertently reorder nodes after dependency sorting, though this is less likely given the test\'s minimal input.\n\n5. **Line 1292**: Forward-declaring types via `getTypeRegistry().forwardDeclareType(provide)` could mask missing provides but doesn\'t explain ordering issues. Included as a secondary suspicion.'}]
