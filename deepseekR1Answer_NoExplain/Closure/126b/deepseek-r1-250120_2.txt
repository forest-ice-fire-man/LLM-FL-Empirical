The code explicitly states in lines 137-140 that finally blocks should NOT be minimized, yet line 143 calls `tryMinimizeExits` on `finallyBlock`. This is a direct contradiction and the primary suspect. Line 137 (comment location) is included as context for this violation. Line 194\'s loop modifying last children could inadvertently affect block structure, and lines 141-144 relate to the problematic finally handling.'}]
