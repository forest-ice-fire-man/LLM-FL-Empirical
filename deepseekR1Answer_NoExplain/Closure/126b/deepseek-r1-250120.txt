This directly implicates the code handling finally blocks in lines 137-144. The comment explicitly warns against minimizing exits in finally blocks (lines 137-140), but line 143 contradicts this by calling `tryMinimizeExits` on the finally block. This is the primary suspect. Secondary suspects include:\n\n1. **Line 141** (`if (NodeUtil.hasFinally(n))`): The conditional enabling the problematic finally block processing.\n2. **Lines 137-140** (comment): Potential misunderstanding of the warning in implementation.\n3. **Line 132** (`Preconditions.checkState`): Could mask issues if catch block structure is unexpected.\n4. **Line 164** (loop over children): General block processing might interfere with control flow analysis.'}]
