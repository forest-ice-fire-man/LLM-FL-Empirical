This incorrectly skips alias detection and prevents the error reporting in the `else` block (line 291), explaining the missing error.\n\n2. **Line 291** (Second most suspicious): The `else` block reports `GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL` errors. If the condition on line 279 is flawed (as above), this block may not execute when it should, directly causing the test failure.\n\n3. **Line 281**: `scope.getVar(name)` could return `null` if the alias is invalid, but there is no null-check before usage in line 285. While not directly causing the test error, this could mask issues.\n\n4. **Line 285**: `aliasVar.getInitialValue()` assumes `aliasVar` is valid. A null `aliasVar` would throw an NPE, but the test error suggests a missing validation (not a crash), making this less likely.\n\n5. **Line 278**: `parent.isVar()` restricts checks to `var` declarations. If the test case includes non-`var` declarations (unlikely given the snippet), this could skip checks. However, the test explicitly uses `var`, making this less relevant.'}]
