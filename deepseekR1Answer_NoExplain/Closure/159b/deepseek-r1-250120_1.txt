The original code\'s `findCalledFunctions` (lines 777-782) only captures direct `NAME` calls (e.g., `foo()`) but misses:  \n1. **Line 779:** Fails to handle property-based calls (e.g., `preload_check_all.call()`) since `child.getType() == Token.NAME` only checks the first child of the `CALL` node (which is `GETPROP` for method calls).  \n2. **Line 780:** Adds the incomplete identifier (e.g., `call` instead of `preload_check_all`).  \n3. **Line 778:** Stops at the first child of the `CALL` node instead of traversing deeper into nested structures.  \n4. **Line 784:** Recursive traversal might process nodes too late to capture the missing reference.  \n\nThe primary issue is the inability to resolve the base identifier in method calls (line 779).'}]
