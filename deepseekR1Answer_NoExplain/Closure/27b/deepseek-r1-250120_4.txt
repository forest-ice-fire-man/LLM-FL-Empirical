The root cause is that `block(catchNode)` in line 233 attempts to enforce that `catchNode` is a block, but `catchNode` is actually a `CATCH` node (not a block). The correct value should be `catchNode.getBody()` instead of `catchNode`. Line 234 is suspicious next because it propagates the invalid `catchBody`. Line 231 is less likely but included as a sanity check for the `tryBody` validation.'}]
