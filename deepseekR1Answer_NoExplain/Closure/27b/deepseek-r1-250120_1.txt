The same issue applies to line 225 for `finallyBody`. Line 227 is suspicious because the `TRY` node constructor might require a different structure (e.g., missing catch clause handling). Line 226 is less likely but included because `copyInformationFrom` might propagate invalid properties from `tryBody`. The test error message confirms the failure originates from line 224.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 234\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 233\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 232\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 231\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 230\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 233\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 234\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 232\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 231\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 230\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe error occurs because `block(catchNode)` (line 233) is called on a `catchNode`, which is not a block. The `block(...)` method expects a node of type `BLOCK`, but `catchNode` is of type `CATCH`, triggering `Preconditions.checkState` to fail. This matches the stack trace pointing to `IR.block` (line 97) and the unit test\'s structure where `catchNode` is constructed with its own nested block. The fix would involve extracting the block *from* the `catchNode` (e.g., `catchNode.getChild1()`) instead of wrapping the `catchNode` itself in a block. Other lines are less suspicious but included for completeness.'}]
