The unit test passes `IR.block()` (a BLOCK node) as the `tryBody`, which doesn\'t have a label name. This precondition is likely invalid for try-finally structure construction.\n\n2. **Line 225:** Similar logic applies to `finallyBody.isLabelName()`. While the error didn\'t occur here in this test case, passing a BLOCK node to `finallyBody` would also fail this check in other scenarios.\n\n3. **Line 227:** The `TRY` node constructor might expect different child node types (e.g., `catchBody` might need special handling), but this is less likely than the precondition checks being wrong.\n\n4. **Line 226:** The `catchBody` creation from `tryBody` might be suspect if label information shouldn\'t be copied, but this is secondary to the precondition failures.\n\nThe test case reveals the core issue: The precondition checks for `.isLabelName()` on lines 224-225 are incompatible with valid try-finally blocks (which typically use BLOCK nodes, not labeled statements). These checks likely should be validating node type (`isBlock()`) instead of label presence.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 234\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 233\n    }\n  ]\n}', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 233\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 234\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
