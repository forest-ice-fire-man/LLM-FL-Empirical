The unit test passes `IR.block()` (a generic block node, not a labeled statement) as the `tryBody`, violating the check. This makes line 224 the most suspicious.  \n\n**Line 225** is next because the same check applies to `finallyBody`, which also receives a block.  \n\n**Line 227** is suspicious because the `TRY` node constructor might expect a `catch` block (third parameter), but the code creates a `catchBody` from `tryBody` (line 226), which could be invalid if `tryBody` is not a labeled statement.  \n\n**Line 226** is less likely but still relevant, as `copyInformationFrom(tryBody)` might propagate unexpected properties if `tryBody` is invalid.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 233\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 233\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 231\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 232\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error occurs because `block(catchNode)` at line 233 assumes `catchNode` is a block, but the unit test passes a `CATCH` node (created via `IR.catchNode(...)`). The `IR.block()` method (called implicitly here) throws `IllegalStateException` because `catchNode` is not a block. The checks at lines 231-232 are valid (ensuring `tryBody` is a block and `catchNode` is a catch), but line 233 incorrectly treats the `catchNode` itself as a block instead of extracting its body.'}]
