Key suspicions:\n\n1. **Line 86 (`renamer = rootRenamer`):**  \n   If `rootRenamer` retains state across test runs (e.g., via static references), its internal counter for generating unique variable suffixes (like `$$inline_0`) would increment globally, causing test failures. This is the most likely culprit.\n\n2. **Line 92 (loop adding declared names):**  \n   If the renamer incorrectly increments its counter during function parameter processing (e.g., double-counting parameters), it could cause premature suffix increments.\n\n3. **Line 88 (`nameStack.peek().forChildScope()`):**  \n   If child scopes inherit a stale/non-reset counter from the parent renamer, suffixes could increment unexpectedly.\n\n4. **Lines 97/101 (`findDeclaredNames` calls):**  \n   Recursive logic here might mishandle renamer state propagation across nested scopes, leading to counter drift.\n\nThe test failure suggests the renaming state persists between test runs, making **line 86** the prime suspect due to improper `rootRenamer` initialization/reset.'}]
