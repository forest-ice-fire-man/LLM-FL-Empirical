For a two-tailed test, the p-value should be `2 * min(P(Z ≤ z), P(Z ≥ |z|))`. The current implementation doubles `cumulativeProbability(z)`, which is only valid for negative `z`. For positive `z`, this would produce values > 1 (invalid). The correct approach is `2 * Math.min(cumulativeProbability(z), 1 - cumulativeProbability(z))`. In the test case, `z` is extremely negative, leading to a near-zero p-value (correct for this scenario), but the general implementation is flawed.\n\n2. **Line 179** (`final double z = (Umin - EU) / FastMath.sqrt(VarU);`):  \n   The calculation does not apply a continuity correction (e.g., `±0.5` adjustment to `Umin`), which is recommended for discrete distributions like the Mann-Whitney U statistic. While negligible for large samples, its absence could reduce accuracy in edge cases (e.g., small `Umin`).\n\n3. **Line 177** (`final double VarU = n1n2prod * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12.0;`):  \n   The variance formula assumes no ties in the data. If ties exist (not in the test case), this formula underestimates the variance. However, the test case has no ties, so this is not the immediate cause of failure but a latent issue.'}]
