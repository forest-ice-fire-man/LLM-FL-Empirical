This formula works **only when `z` is negative**. For positive `z`, it erroneously returns values >1 (invalid p-values). The correct approach is `2 * standardNormal.cumulativeProbability(-Math.abs(z))` to ensure valid two-tailed results. This is the most severe bug.\n\n2. **Line 179 (Secondary Issue):**  \n   The z-score calculation `(Umin - EU) / FastMath.sqrt(VarU)` lacks a **continuity correction** (±0.5 adjustment). The formula should be `(Umin - EU ± 0.5) / FastMath.sqrt(VarU)` depending on the direction of `Umin`. This omission reduces accuracy, especially for smaller datasets.\n\n3. **Line 177 (Low Suspicion):**  \n   The variance formula `n1n2prod * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12` assumes no ties in the data. While this is valid in the unit test (no ties), the code does not include tie-correction logic, making it fragile for general use. However, this is not the direct cause of the test failure here.'}]
