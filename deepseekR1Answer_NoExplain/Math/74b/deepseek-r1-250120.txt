If `fsal` is intended to reuse the last stage\'s derivatives but the condition fails to skip the first stage computation, evaluations will increase significantly.\n\n2. **Line 328 (`System.arraycopy(...)`):**  \n   If the FSAL stage index (`stages - 1`) is incorrect (e.g., due to a mismatch between the integrator\'s expected stages and the actual array size), this copy operation would fail to reuse the correct derivatives, forcing extra evaluations.\n\n3. **Line 203 (`final int stages = c.length + 1`):**  \n   If `c.length` does not align with the integrator\'s intended stages (e.g., Adams-Moulton expects multi-step logic, not Runge-Kutta stages), this line would create more stages than necessary, leading to redundant `computeDerivatives` calls.\n\n4. **Line 349 (`nextT >= t`/`nextT <= t`):**  \n   An incorrect termination condition (e.g., using `>=` instead of `>`) might cause the integrator to overshoot the final time `t`, requiring extra steps and evaluations to correct.\n\n5. **Line 284 (`error = estimateError(...)`):**  \n   A faulty error estimation could lead to overly conservative step size adjustments, resulting in smaller steps and more evaluations than necessary to meet tolerance criteria.'}]
