This leads to missed events at the same timestamp.\n\n2. **Line 337**: After a reset, the method returns immediately. Subsequent events in the current step may be skipped, as the loop terminates early.\n\n3. **Line 365**: `Precision.equals(currentT, tEnd, 1)` uses a hard-coded tolerance of 1, which may be too large for many integration scenarios, risking premature termination.\n\n4. **Lines 304 & 354**: Adding events to `occuringEvents` may fail due to the flawed comparator (line 292), causing valid events to be erroneously excluded from processing.', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 292\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 337\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 296\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 354\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 348\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Line 292**: The custom comparator for `occuringEvents` uses `orderingSign * Double.compare(...)`, which inverts event order when integrating backward. However, this comparator is created once per step and does not adapt if the integrator direction changes mid-step (e.g., via reset). This can cause events to be processed in reverse chronological order, leading to time regression.\n\n2. **Line 337**: Returning immediately after a reset (without processing subsequent events in the current step) can skip later valid events (e.g., 11.01 in the test case), causing incomplete state updates and forcing the integrator to reprocess earlier intervals.\n\n3. **Line 296**: The comparator\'s use of `Double.compare` with multiplied `orderingSign` might lead to incorrect event ordering during forward integration if events are re-added with adjusted times (e.g., due to state changes in `currentEvent.reset`).\n\n4. **Line 354**: Re-adding `currentEvent` to `occuringEvents` after a partial step (eventT to currentT) might include invalid times if `evaluateStep` erroneously detects events outside the current sub-interval due to improper soft time handling.\n\n5. **Line 348**: `interpolator.setSoftPreviousTime(eventT)` after an event might not correctly confine the interpolator to the sub-step (eventT to currentT), allowing `evaluateStep` to detect events from earlier intervals (e.g., 7.79 in the test case).'}]
