The most suspicious line is **184** (`long result = Math.round(binomialCoefficientDouble(n, k))`) because:\n\n1. **Line 184** uses floating-point arithmetic (`binomialCoefficientDouble`) followed by rounding. This is inherently lossy for large values, as doubles cannot precisely represent all integers beyond 2⁵³. The discrepancy of 1 suggests cumulative rounding errors in intermediate calculations.\n\n2. **Line 208** (the `return result` line) is secondary because it merely returns the already-incorrect value computed in line 184.\n\n3. **Line 185** (`if (result == Long.MAX_VALUE)`) is less likely but still relevant because the overflow check might mask precision issues if intermediate values overflowed before rounding.\n\nThe other lines handle edge cases (e.g., n=k, k=0) and are unlikely to affect (48,22). The root cause is the reliance on floating-point arithmetic in line 184 for exact integer results.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 236\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 236\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
