The most suspicious line is **184**, where `Math.round(binomialCoefficientDouble(...))` is used. Floating-point rounding errors in `binomialCoefficientDouble` could cause off-by-one errors when cast to `long`. Additional considerations:\n- **208**: The return statement might mask intermediate overflow issues not caught by the `Long.MAX_VALUE` check (line 185).\n- **181**: The shortcut for `k=1` or `k=n-1` is correct but could indicate broader logic gaps in symmetry handling.\n- **190**: The commented symmetry optimization for large `k` might not be fully implemented, leading to unnecessary precision loss.\n- **185**: The `Long.MAX_VALUE` check might not detect precision-related underflows.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 236\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 236\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
