The test case configures a `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` (which runs multiple optimization attempts and selects the best result). However, line 97 directly returns `optimizer.getResult()`, which likely refers to the result of the **underlying optimizer** (e.g., `BrentOptimizer`) from its **last run**, not the **best result** across all attempts. The correct approach would be to retrieve the best result from the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer`\'s internal collection of optima (e.g., via `getOptima()` or similar methods). This explains the slight numerical discrepancy in the test.'}]
