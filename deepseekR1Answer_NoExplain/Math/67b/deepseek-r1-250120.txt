The error arises because `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` (line 97) returns a result that does not meet the expected precision. The root cause is likely in how the `optimizer` (e.g., `BrentOptimizer`) is configured or how its result is propagated. The test explicitly relaxes the accuracy thresholds (lines 65-66 in the test), but if the `getResult()` method (line 97) directly returns the underlying optimizer\'s result without ensuring it reflects the *best* result from multiple starts (due to improper aggregation or synchronization), the precision error occurs. The line is flagged as the most suspicious because it directly retrieves the result without visible safeguards for multi-start consistency.'}]
