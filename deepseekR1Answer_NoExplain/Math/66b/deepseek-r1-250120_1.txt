This mismatch could cause the optimization to use the wrong goal type.\n\n2. **Lines 62-63**: The parameters `min`, `startValue`, and `max` are passed to `localMin` in the order `min, startValue, max`. If `localMin` expects the initial guess (`startValue`) to be the third argument (after `min` and `max`), this would be correct. However, if `localMin` expects the bounds to be `lower, upper` followed by the initial guess, the order here is correct. Without the implementation of `localMin`, this is less certain but still a potential point of failure if the parameter order is incorrect. \n\nThe primary suspicion is on line 61 due to the use of `getGoalType()` instead of the `goalType` parameter. Lines 62-63 are included as secondary suspicions due to possible parameter order issues in `localMin`.', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 61\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 63\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 62\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe test failure shows a numerical precision discrepancy in the optimization result. This strongly suggests issues with accuracy settings or parameter order in the `localMin` call:\n\n1. **Line 61**: The boolean argument `getGoalType() == GoalType.MINIMIZE` uses the class\'s internal `GoalType` instead of the `goalType` parameter passed to the method. If the class\'s internal state does not match the parameter (e.g., due to incorrect initialization), this would cause the optimizer to search in the wrong direction (maximize instead of minimize), leading to incorrect results. This is the most likely root cause.\n\n2. **Line 63**: The `getRelativeAccuracy()` and `getAbsoluteAccuracy()` methods return the *MultiStartOptimizer*’s accuracy settings, which were explicitly increased by a factor of 10 in the test (lines 66-67). This reduces precision, causing the underlying optimizer (Brent) to terminate early and return a less accurate result. The test expects high precision (1e-15), so this mismatch explains the assertion failure.\n\n3. **Line 62**: The parameter order `min, startValue, max` passed to `localMin` is suspicious. If `localMin` expects the initial guess (`startValue`) to be the third argument (after `min` and `max`), this is correct. However, if the method expects `lowerBound, initialGuess, upperBound`, the order here is invalid. This could cause the optimizer to operate on an invalid interval, leading to subtle numerical errors.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 66\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 66\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe primary suspicion remains on line 66 due to the precision-sensitive calculation of the initial guess point (`min + GOLDEN_SECTION * (max - min)`). The test failure (discrepancy in the 8th decimal place) strongly suggests a numerical precision issue originating from this line. Potential root causes include:\n\n1. **Inaccurate `GOLDEN_SECTION` constant**: If the golden ratio is not represented with sufficient precision (e.g., hardcoded as 0.618 instead of `(Math.sqrt(5)-1)/2` ≈ 0.6180339887498949), the initial guess will be slightly misaligned, propagating through the optimization iterations.\n\n2. **BrentOptimizer sensitivity**: The test configures the BrentOptimizer with an extremely tight relative accuracy (`1e-15`). Minor deviations in the initial guess (due to floating-point error in line 66\'s calculation) could cause the optimizer to terminate at a slightly different point within the tolerance threshold, yet still fail the exact equality check in the test.\n\nNo other lines in the original snippet (65-66) show actionable issues.
