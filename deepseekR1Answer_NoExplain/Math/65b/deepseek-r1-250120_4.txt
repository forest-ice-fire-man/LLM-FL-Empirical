In weighted least squares, the correct denominator is often the **sum of weights** (or `m - n` degrees of freedom in optimization contexts), not the number of observations (`rows`). This mismatch explains the lower-than-expected RMS value in the test case. For example, if the test expects division by degrees of freedom (`rows - parameters`), using `rows` here would produce a smaller RMS.\n\n2. **Line 243 (`criterion += residual * residual * residualsWeights[i]`):**  \n   The weights are applied multiplicatively to squared residuals. If weights should instead represent inverse variances (requiring division, e.g., `residual^2 / weight[i]`), this would underweight residuals when weights are >1, leading to a smaller `criterion`. While not directly applicable to the provided test (weights = 1), this could explain failures in other cases.\n\n3. **Line 241 (`for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i`)**:  \n   If `rows` does not correctly reflect the number of residuals (e.g., due to an off-by-one error or incorrect initialization), the loop would process an incorrect number of residuals, leading to an invalid sum. This could occur if `rows` is mistakenly set to a value larger than the actual residuals array length, causing under-summation (via early termination) and a lower RMS.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 258\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 256\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 257\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 256\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 258\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 257\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
