This corrupts pivot selection, leading to incorrect matrix transformations. **Primary cause of reconstruction errors** in the test case.\n\n2. **Line 115 (`++r`):**  \n   When the code detects all remaining diagonals are near-zero (rank found), incrementing `r` here inflates the rank by 1. The root matrix then has an extra column, causing inaccuracies in `root.multiply(root.transpose())`.\n\n3. **Line 128 (`c[ii][ii] -= e * e`):**  \n   Diagonal updates depend on correct pivot indices. If `index` is corrupted (due to line 82), this propagates errors in the Cholesky decomposition.\n\n4. **Line 83 (`c[ii][ii] > c[isi][isi]`):**  \n   The comparison uses `isi` derived from the corrupted `swap[i]` (line 82), leading to incorrect pivot comparisons.\n\n5. **Line 90 (`if (swap[r] != r)`):**  \n   Swapping logic assumes `swap[r]` is valid, but corrupted `swap` values (from line 82) may cause unnecessary/erroneous permutations.'}]
