This causes faulty pivoting and numerical instability, directly impacting the decomposition\'s accuracy.\n\n2. **Line 128 (`c[ii][ii] -= e * e`):**  \n   In-place modification of the matrix `c` during decomposition could propagate rounding errors, especially when repeated across iterations. This might explain the non-zero norm in the test.\n\n3. **Line 138 (`loop = ++r < order`):**  \n   If the loop terminates prematurely due to an off-by-one error in rank calculation, the decomposition would produce an under-ranked root matrix, causing reconstruction inaccuracies.\n\n4. **Line 98 (`if (c[ir][ir] < small`):**  \n   A strict check against `small` might incorrectly flag valid small-but-positive diagonal elements as "zero," halting the decomposition early and truncating the rank.\n\n5. **Line 116 (`loop = false`):**  \n   Early loop termination when detecting near-zero diagonals might skip critical updates, especially if the matrix has trailing non-zero elements that weren\'t properly checked.'}]
