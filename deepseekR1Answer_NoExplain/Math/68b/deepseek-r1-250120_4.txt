A precision error here (e.g., incorrect `actRed`/`preRed` due to floating-point division) could prematurely accept/reject steps, causing small parameter deviations like those observed in the test failure.\n\n2. **Line 312 (`for (double ratio = 0; ratio < 1.0e-4;)`):**\n   - The fixed threshold `1.0e-4` might be too strict for the Jennrich-Sampson test case, terminating the inner loop before achieving sufficient precision. A smaller threshold (e.g., `1.0e-6`) could allow finer convergence.\n\n3. **Line 262 (`jacobian[k][pk] = diagR[pk]`):**\n   - Incorrect permutation handling or `diagR` values (from QR decomposition) would corrupt the R matrix, leading to erroneous step direction calculations.\n\n4. **Line 270 (`for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k)`):**\n   - The loop computes `xNorm` using `jacNorm` for scaling. If `jacNorm` is incorrectly initialized (e.g., due to QR issues), `xNorm` and the trust region `delta` (line 282) will be miscomputed, limiting refinement.\n\n5. **Line 279 (`xNorm = Math.sqrt(xNorm)`):**\n   - Final `xNorm` truncation during initialization could propagate rounding errors into the trust region radius (`delta`), restricting parameter adjustments in later iterations.'}]
