In Levenberg-Marquardt, the direction vector should already be computed as the negative gradient (solving $(J^T J + \\lambda I) \\delta = -J^T r$). An extra negation could reverse the step direction, causing incorrect parameter updates and subtle numerical discrepancies like the observed error.\n\n2. **Line 374 (`ratio = (preRed == 0) ? 0 : (actRed / preRed)`):**  \n   If `preRed` (predicted reduction) is computed with insufficient precision due to floating-point errors (e.g., small values in `coeff1` or `coeff2`), the ratio could be miscalculated. This might lead to improper acceptance/rejection of steps, causing convergence to a slightly suboptimal point.\n\n3. **Line 348 (`if (0.1 * cost < previousCost)`):**  \n   This heuristic to compute `actRed` (actual reduction) might fail to capture small but valid reductions in the cost function. If `actRed` is forced to `-1.0` when the cost decreases by less than 10%, the step could be incorrectly rejected, halting progress prematurely.\n\n4. **Line 312 (`for (double ratio = 0; ratio < 1.0e-4;)`):**  \n   The loop condition uses a hard-coded threshold (`1.0e-4`) to adjust the trust region. If this threshold is too strict for the Jennrich-Sampson test case, it might terminate the inner loop too early, preventing fine-grained adjustments to `lmPar` and `delta`.\n\n5. **Line 368 (`coeff1 = coeff1 / pc2`):**  \n   Division by `previousCost^2` (`pc2`) could amplify numerical instability if `previousCost` is very small, leading to erroneous `preRed` values. This would directly affect the ratio calculation and step acceptance logic.'}]
