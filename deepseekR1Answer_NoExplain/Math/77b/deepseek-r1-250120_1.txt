This leads to an exponentially increasing value (e.g., 128 instead of 6 in the test case). The correct logic should use `max = Math.max(max, Math.abs(a))` to update the maximum.\n\n2. **Line 719 (Secondary Suspicion):**\n   - Initializing `max` to `0` may cause incorrect results if all elements are negative (since `max` would start at 0 instead of the smallest negativeâ€™s absolute value). However, this is not the root cause here, as the test case includes both positive and negative values, and the primary failure is due to line 721.\n\n3. **Other Lines:**\n   - Line 720 (`for` loop) and line 723 (`return`) are correct and not suspicious.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 503\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 499\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 503\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 499\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
