The L-Infinity norm (maximum absolute value) is incorrectly calculated as a sum of entries instead of tracking the maximum absolute value. This explains the test failure (`expected 6.0` but got `-3.0`, which matches the sum of `vec5` entries: `-4 + 0 + 3 + 1 + (-6) + 3 = -3`).  \n- **Line 499 (`double max = 0`)** is secondary. While initializing `max` to `0` is technically correct (since norms are non-negative), it could fail if all entries are negative and their absolute maximum is larger than `0`. However, in this test case, the error is directly caused by line 503.'}]
