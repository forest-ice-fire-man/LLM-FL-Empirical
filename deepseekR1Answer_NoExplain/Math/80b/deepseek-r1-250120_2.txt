If `step` is not 1 (e.g., 2 or 4), this loop will fail to iterate over all 4 elements in the block, causing incomplete array flipping. This is critical because eigenvalues depend on precise matrix structure. The test failure (incorrect eigenvalue magnitude) strongly suggests improper array manipulation during flipping.\n\n2. **Line 1133** (`if (1.5 * work[pingPong] < work[4 * (n - 1) + pingPong])`):  \n   The indices `pingPong` and `4 * (n - 1) + pingPong` might not correctly reference the intended elements of the `work` array. A miscalculation here could cause unnecessary (or missed) flips, leading to eigenvalues diverging from expected results.\n\n3. **Line 1135** (`int j = 4 * n - 1;`):  \n   If `n` is incorrectly calculated (e.g., off-by-one error), `j` could point to an invalid index in the `work` array. This would corrupt swaps and explain the test\'s large numerical discrepancy.\n\n4. **Line 1140** (`work[j - k] = tmp;`):  \n   If `step > 1`, the index `j - k` might not symmetrically mirror `i + k` due to incomplete iterations in line 1137. This would leave parts of the array unflipped, introducing numerical instability in eigenvalue calculations.\n\n5. **Line 1136** (`for (int i = 0; i < j; i += 4)`):  \n   The loop termination condition `i < j` could prematurely exit if `j` is updated incorrectly in line 1142 (`j -= 4`), leaving trailing elements unprocessed. This would compound errors in the flip operation.'}]
