If `step > 1` (e.g., `step=4` in some contexts), this loop will fail to iterate over all 4 elements of the block, causing incomplete array flipping. This directly corrupts the matrix structure and eigenvalues.  \n\n2. **Line 1136:**  \n   The outer loop `for (int i = 0; i < j; i += 4)` assumes 4-element blocks. If `j` is miscalculated (line 1135), this could lead to misaligned blocks.  \n\n3. **Line 1135:**  \n   `int j = 4 * n - 1` defines the starting index for flipping. If `n` is incorrectly derived, `j` would point to the wrong position.  \n\n4. **Line 1133:**  \n   The condition `1.5 * work[pingPong] < work[...]` determines whether to flip. An incorrect threshold could trigger flips unnecessarily or skip required ones.  \n\n5. **Line 1140:**  \n   `work[j - k] = tmp` swaps elements symmetrically. If `j - k` is miscomputed (due to issues in `j` or `k`), this could overwrite wrong indices.  \n\nThe primary culprit is **line 1137**, as the `step` parameter likely conflicts with the 4-element block assumption in eigen decomposition.'}]
