If `start` is modified due to aggressive point dropping (e.g., in flat regions like the test case), this could misalign the index, leading to invalid bracketing and failure to converge.\n\n2. **Line 339 (`signChangeIndex++`):**  \n   Incrementing `signChangeIndex` after inserting a new point might shift the index beyond the valid range of the `x`/`y` arrays. This could cause misalignment between the sign change interval and the actual root location, especially in edge cases with steep gradients.\n\n3. **Line 260 (`if (signChangeIndex - start >= end - signChangeIndex)`):**  \n   The heuristic for dropping points may discard critical information in flat-function scenarios. For the test caseâ€™s sharp turn, this logic might retain points on the wrong side of the root, preventing the solver from narrowing the interval effectively.\n\n4. **Line 184 (`if (y[1] * y[2] < 0)`):**  \n   The sign-change check here uses a simple multiplication, which can fail due to underflow or precision issues when function values are extremely small (as in `1.0e-22` function accuracy). This might incorrectly throw `NoBracketingException` instead of proceeding with valid bracketing.\n\n5. **Line 254 (`if (!((nextX > xA) && (nextX < xB))`):**  \n   Strictly requiring `nextX` to be inside `xA`/`xB` might reject valid guesses due to floating-point rounding errors. In the test case, the solver might oscillate near the root without progressing due to overly strict bounds checks.'}]
