Key suspects:\n\n1. **Lines 316 & 318** (`System.arraycopy`): Incorrect array management during point insertion may lose critical bracketing information, especially problematic for sharp-turn functions requiring precise interval tracking.\n\n2. **Line 337** (`signChangeIndex++`): Over-aggressive index increment when updating the sign change position might skip valid narrowing opportunities, causing oscillation instead of convergence.\n\n3. **Line 297** (`signChangeIndex -= start`): Improper index adjustment after dropping points could misalign the sign change tracking relative to the remaining points.\n\n4. **Line 252** (`guessX(...)`): Inverse polynomial interpolation might fail to account for the function\'s extreme curvature, forcing excessive bisection steps (though less likely than array/index issues).\n\nThe test\'s sharp turn exacerbates array/index misalignment issues, causing the solver to stagnate rather than refine the root.'}]
