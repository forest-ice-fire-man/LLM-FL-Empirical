This would corrupt the tableau by removing critical constraint constants, leading to invalid solutions. The test failure (incorrect variable signs/values) strongly suggests missing RHS data.\n\n2. **Line 336 (loop bounds for phase 1 cleanup):**  \n   The loop iterates from `getNumObjectiveFunctions()` to `getArtificialVariableOffset()` to identify variables with positive costs. If `getArtificialVariableOffset()` incorrectly overlaps with artificial variable indices, this could prematurely terminate the loop or miss valid columns.\n\n3. **Line 351 (matrix dimension calculation):**  \n   `getHeight() - 1` assumes only one row (phase 1 objective) is removed. If phase 1 required multiple rows (e.g., for slack variables), this would miscalculate the matrix size, causing truncation or misalignment.\n\n4. **Line 344 (artificial variable cleanup):**  \n   The loop condition `i < getNumArtificialVariables()` might fail to account for artificial variables introduced during phase 1, leaving stale columns in the tableau and corrupting phase 2.\n\n5. **Line 361 (column label removal):**  \n   Removing column labels using the original indices (pre-drop) could misalign labels with the updated tableau if columns are dropped out of order. Reverse iteration mitigates this, but a logic error here could persist.'}]
