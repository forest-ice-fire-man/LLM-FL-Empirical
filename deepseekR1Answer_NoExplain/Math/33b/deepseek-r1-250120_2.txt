The most critical issue is in **line 337**, where `tableau.getEntry(0, i)` incorrectly references the Phase 1 objective row (row 0) instead of the Phase 2 objective row (likely row 1). This causes columns to be dropped based on Phase 1\'s coefficients, corrupting the Phase 2 tableau. Other lines (e.g., matrix initialization in 351, column iteration in 336, and column filtering in 355) remain suspicious but less critical.'}]
