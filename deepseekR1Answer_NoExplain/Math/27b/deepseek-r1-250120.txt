The `multiply(100)` operation likely performs integer arithmetic, which overflows to a negative value before converting to a `double`. This matches the test failure (`-2.125791896E9` instead of `2.1691754E9`). The fix would involve ensuring the multiplication uses a wider type (e.g., `long`) to avoid overflow.'}]
