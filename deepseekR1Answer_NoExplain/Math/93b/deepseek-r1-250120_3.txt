This array was likely initialized using the same error-prone rounding logic in line 345, making this line the most suspicious.  \n- **Line 345** (`long result = Math.round(factorialDouble(n));`): Floating-point precision limitations in `factorialDouble(n)` (e.g., for large `n`) can cause `Math.round` to produce incorrect integer values, corrupting the `factorials` array.  \n\nThe test error (`3.55687428096001E14` vs. `3.55687428096E14`) directly implicates precision loss in the `factorialDouble`/rounding process, which propagates into the array. The code snippet does not show the array initialization logic, but line 350 exposes its corrupted state.'}]
