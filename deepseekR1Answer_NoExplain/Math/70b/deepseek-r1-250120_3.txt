The 2-argument `solve` likely depends on an internal function field that was never initialized (since the 4-argument method fails to propagate `f`). Line 72 is the most suspicious because it directly causes the uninitialized function usage. Line 70 is also suspicious due to its unused `f` parameter, which indicates a mismatch between the method signature and implementation.'}]
