The 4-argument `solve` method (lines 70-72) receives `f` as input but fails to propagate it to the overloaded method, causing the solver to operate on a `null` function reference. Line 72 is the most suspicious, followed by the method signature (line 70) and exception declarations (line 71), which may mask the root cause by throwing overly broad exceptions.'}]
