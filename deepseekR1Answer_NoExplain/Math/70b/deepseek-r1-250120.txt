This likely causes the parent class implementation (e.g., `BisectionSolver`) to use an uninitialized/null `f` when evaluating the function, leading to the `NullPointerException` in the test.  \n2. **Line 70** is secondary because the method signature includes an unused `initial` parameter. While this doesnâ€™t directly cause the NPE, it indicates a design flaw (e.g., the `initial` value is not used for bracketing or solver initialization).  \n\nThe error occurs because the overridden `solve` method (lines 70-72) fails to propagate the `f` parameter to the parent class solver logic, resulting in a missing/uninitialized function reference during root-finding.'}]
