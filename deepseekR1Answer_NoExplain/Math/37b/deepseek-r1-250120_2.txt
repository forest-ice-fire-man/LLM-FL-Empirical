This line calculates the real part of the result, which should be 1.0 for `infOne` input but becomes NaN due to improper handling of infinity.\n\n2. **Line 1068:** The denominator `d = FastMath.cosh(real2) + FastMath.cos(imaginary2)` becomes `∞ + finite = ∞` when `real` is large. While mathematically correct, this contributes to the NaN result in line 1070 when combined with the numerator.\n\n3. **Line 1071:** The imaginary part calculation `FastMath.sin(imaginary2) / d` is less suspicious in this specific test case (since it produces 0.0 correctly), but could cause issues for other infinity-related inputs.\n\n4. **Line 1063:** The initial `isNaN` check misses special handling for infinite values, allowing the code to proceed with invalid calculations for infinite inputs.\n\n5. **Line 1066:** While `real2 = 2.0 * real` is technically correct, propagating infinity through this operation contributes to the NaN result downstream.\n\nThe root cause is the lack of special-case handling for infinite values in the input, but this analysis focuses on the *existing code\'s* fault lines rather than suggesting missing checks.'}]
