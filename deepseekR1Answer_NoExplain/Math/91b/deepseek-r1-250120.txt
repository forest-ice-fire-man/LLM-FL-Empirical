This is fundamentally flawed because:  \n1. **Loss of precision** (lines 259-260): Converting fractions to `double` discards precision, especially for fractions with large numerators/denominators like `pi1` and `pi2` in the test. Their `doubleValue()` might be identical even if the fractions are distinct.  \n2. **Incorrect comparison logic** (line 261): The ternary logic correctly handles the comparison of `double` values, but the root problem is the use of `double` itself. The method should compare fractions **exactly** via cross-multiplication (e.g., `this.numerator * other.denominator` vs. `other.numerator * this.denominator`) to avoid precision loss.  \n\nThe failing test case (`pi1.compareTo(pi2)`) exposes this flaw: the fractions are distinct but have the same `doubleValue()`, causing the method to incorrectly return `0` instead of `-1`. Line 261 is the most suspicious as it directly returns the erroneous result.'}]
