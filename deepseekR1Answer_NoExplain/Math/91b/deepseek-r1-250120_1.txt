This leads to precision loss when comparing fractions with nearly identical double representations but different exact values (like `pi1` and `pi2` in the test case). The `double` type cannot distinguish between these two fractions, causing the comparison to incorrectly return `0` instead of `-1`. The root cause is the use of floating-point comparison (lines 259-261) rather than exact fraction comparison via cross-multiplication (e.g., `a/b vs c/d` should compare `a*d` vs `b*c`). Line 261 is the most suspicious as it implements the flawed comparison logic.'}]
