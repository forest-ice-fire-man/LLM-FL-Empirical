The test case compares two nearly identical approximations of Ï€ (`pi1` and `pi2`) whose `doubleValue()` results are equal (due to floating-point precision limits), causing the method to incorrectly return `0` instead of `-1`. The root cause is the reliance on floating-point comparison in **line 261**, which fails to distinguish between fractions that are mathematically distinct but numerically equivalent at `double` precision. The fix would involve comparing numerators/denominators directly via cross-multiplication (e.g., `this.numerator * other.denominator` vs. `other.numerator * this.denominator`) to avoid precision loss.'}]
