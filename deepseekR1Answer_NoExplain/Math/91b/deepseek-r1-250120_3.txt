When fractions are very close but not equal (like the PI approximations in the test case), their `double` representations might be identical due to limited precision, causing an incorrect `0` result. Line 261 is most suspicious because it performs the flawed comparison. Lines 259-260 are secondary suspects because they compute the imprecise `double` values. The correct fix would compare fractions using cross-multiplication (avoiding floating-point conversion).'}]
