The condition `if (!(meanImpl instanceof Mean))` on line 158 skips updating the overridden `Mean` instance, leaving its internal state uninitialized. This causes `getMean()` to return `NaN` (0/0 division). Line 158 is the root cause because it incorrectly assumes that any `Mean` instance (even overridden ones) do not require explicit updates. Line 167 (`n++`) is also suspicious because `Mean` might rely on its own counter instead of `n`, but this is secondary. Other checks (lines 161/164) follow the same flawed pattern but are less relevant to the specific error.'}]
