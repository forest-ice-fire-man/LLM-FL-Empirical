The root cause is in **line 158**:  \n```java\nif (!(meanImpl instanceof Mean)) { ... }\n```  \nThis condition skips incrementing `meanImpl` if it is an instance of `Mean` (even a user-provided one). When `stats.setMeanImpl(new Mean())` is called in the test, the `meanImpl` is not updated because it passes the `instanceof` check, leading to uninitialized data (NaN).  \n\nOther lines (167, 159, 150, 155) are included as secondary suspects due to potential issues with state tracking (e.g., `n++` not being thread-safe, or dependencies on other accumulators like `sumImpl`). However, **line 158** is the primary suspect based on the error context.'}]
