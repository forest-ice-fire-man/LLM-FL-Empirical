In the original code, the condition `if (!(meanImpl instanceof Mean))` (line 158) skips incrementing the `meanImpl` when it is explicitly set to a `Mean` instance (as in the test). This leaves the `meanImpl` in an uninitialized state, causing `getMean()` to return `NaN`. The same logic applies to `varianceImpl` (line 161) and `geoMeanImpl` (line 164). Line 167 (`n++`) and line 150 (`sumImpl.increment`) are less likely culprits but still relevant to state consistency. The order reflects the likelihood of causing the `NaN` error.'}]
