Specifically:\n\n1. **Line 373 (`res.setEntry(...)`)** is the most suspicious because it directly modifies the `res` vector during iteration. This invalidates the iterator, causing the concurrent modification exception.  \n2. **Line 370 (`Iterator iter = res.entries.iterator()`)** is suspicious because it creates an iterator over `res.entries`, but `res` is being modified during iteration. The iterator should instead iterate over the original vector (`this.entries`), not the copy being modified.  \n\nThe fix would be to iterate over `this.entries` (the original vector) while updating `res`, ensuring no concurrent modification occurs.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 383\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 386\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 384\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 382\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
