Key findings:\n\n1. **Line 258 (Most suspicious):**  \n   The code returns `INF` when dividing by zero unless both operands are zero. However, mathematically, division by zero in complex arithmetic should **always** result in `NaN`. This directly explains why `atan(I)` (which involves division by zero in its computation) fails to return `NaN`.\n\n2. **Line 263:**  \n   The check `divisor.isInfinite() && !isInfinite()` returns `ZERO`, but this may not handle cases where intermediate computations involving infinities (e.g., in inverse trigonometric functions) should propagate `NaN`.\n\n3. **Line 254:**  \n   The `isNaN` check might not account for all edge cases where intermediate computations (e.g., during `atan`) could generate `NaN`.\n\n4. **Lines 270/276:**  \n   Numerical instability in the division algorithm (e.g., underflow/overflow in `FastMath.abs(c) < FastMath.abs(d)`) might cause unexpected results in edge cases, though less likely here.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 292\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 297\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 300\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 295\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 299\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
