This causes the initial point (which may remain the best) to be lost if not preserved in `current`/`previous` during later iterations.\n\n2. **Line 149** (initial `current` setup): The initial guess is stored in `current`, but subsequent iterations overwrite it. If the initial point is the best, there\'s no mechanism to retain it after `current` is updated.\n\n3. **Line 242** (update logic): The condition `fu <= fx` determines whether to adopt `u` as the new `x`. However, the final result relies on `current`/`previous` instead of `x`, creating a disconnect between the algorithm\'s internal best (`x`) and the returned value.\n\n4. **Line 232** (`previous = current`): This overwrites `previous` with the previous `current`, potentially discarding the initial point if it was not explicitly tracked as the overall best.\n\nThe root cause is the lack of a dedicated variable to track the absolute best point across all iterations. The code erroneously assumes the last two points (`current` and `previous`) contain the best solution, which fails when the initial point is optimal but later iterations explore worse regions.'}]
