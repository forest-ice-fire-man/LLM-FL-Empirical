However, the code in line 209 (`return chromosomes.iterator();`) likely returns a modifiable iterator (e.g., from an `ArrayList`), allowing `remove()` to succeed instead of throwing the expected exception. The root cause is that the `iterator()` method in line 209 does not enforce immutability, conflicting with the test\'s expectation. No other lines in the provided snippet are relevant to this issue.'}]
