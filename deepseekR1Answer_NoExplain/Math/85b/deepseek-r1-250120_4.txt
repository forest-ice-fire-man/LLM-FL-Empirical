This check should allow `fa * fb <= 0` (indicating a root is bracketed) instead of requiring strict negativity. This is the most critical issue.\n\n2. **Line 195 (`(fa * fb > 0.0) && ...`):**  \n   The loop condition stops expanding the interval if `fa * fb <= 0`, but the subsequent check on line 198 incorrectly rejects the valid `fa * fb = 0` case. This mismatch in logic contributes to premature termination.\n\n3. **Lines 189-190 (`a = Math.max(a - 1.0, lowerBound); b = Math.min(b + 1.0, upperBound);`):**  \n   The fixed step size of `1.0` may fail to expand the interval aggressively enough for large domains (e.g., `upperBound = 1e308` in the error), causing the loop to exit too early when `a`/`b` hit bounds. A multiplicative expansion (e.g., doubling) would be more robust.\n\n4. **Line 193 (`fb = function.value(b);`):**  \n   The test case reveals `f(b) = 0` at `b = 2`, but the code fails to recognize this valid root due to the flawed check on line 198. While the computation of `fb` itself is correct, the surrounding logic mishandles its result.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the code snippet’s logic for interval expansion and root validation, which directly aligns with the `ConvergenceException` triggered in the test case. The unit test’s parameters (extremely large `upperBound`, `initial = 1`) exacerbate weaknesses in the bracketing algorithm.'}]
