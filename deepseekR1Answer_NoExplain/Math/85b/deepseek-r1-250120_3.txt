This causes the valid bracket `[0, 2]` (where `f(b) = 0`) to be rejected. The condition should instead check `fa * fb > 0.0`.  \n\nSecondary suspicions include:  \n- **Lines 189/190**: The fixed step size (`1.0`) might prevent efficient bracketing in some cases, though it worked here.  \n- **Line 195**: The loop condition could prematurely exit if `a`/`b` hit bounds, but this was not the case here.  \n- **Line 194**: `numIterations` increments after checking `fa`/`fb`, but this is correct.  \n\nThe root cause remains **line 198**; other lines are less likely but included for completeness.'}]
