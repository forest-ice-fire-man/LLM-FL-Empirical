The condition should be `fa * fb > 0.0` to allow cases where either endpoint is a root (`fa` or `fb` equals 0). This is the most critical issue.\n\n2. **Lines 189 (`a = Math.max(a - 1.0, lowerBound)`) and 190 (`b = Math.min(b + 1.0, upperBound)`):**  \n   - The fixed step size of `1.0` may fail to expand the bracket efficiently for functions with roots far from the initial guess. However, the test case shows the step size *did* reach the correct value (`b=2`), so this is a secondary suspicion.\n\n3. **Lines 182 (`double a = initial`) and 183 (`double b = initial`):**  \n   - Initializing `a` and `b` to the same value (`initial`) forces the loop to expand outward even if the initial point is already valid. This could miss a root at `initial`, but the test case does not trigger this scenario directly. Still, itâ€™s a potential design flaw.'}]
