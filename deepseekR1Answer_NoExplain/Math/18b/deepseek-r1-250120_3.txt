However, if the optimizer\'s internal variables (e.g., in CMA-ES) are scaled differently (e.g., centered around a mean with a sigma parameter), this linear scaling would map values outside the intended bounds, causing incorrect parameter decoding. This explains why the test result is constrained to `8.0` instead of the expected `11.1`.\n\n2. **Line 957 (`double diff = boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i];`):**  \n   When boundaries are extremely large (e.g., `5e16`), floating-point precision loss in `diff` would corrupt the scaling calculation. For example, `boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i]` becomes numerically indistinguishable from `boundaries[1][i]` when the lower bound is very negative, leading to incorrect decoding.\n\n3. **Line 952 (`if (boundaries == null) { return x; }`):**  \n   If boundaries are initialized incorrectly (e.g., not properly reset between test cases), this guard clause might bypass decoding when it should not. However, this is less likely given the test setup.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 992\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 995\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 986\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 991\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
