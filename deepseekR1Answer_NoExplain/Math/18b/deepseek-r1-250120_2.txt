The most suspicious lines are:\n\n1. **Line 932**: `res[i] = (x[i] - boundaries[0][i]) / diff;`  \n   Dividing by a very large `diff` (boundary range) can result in underflow/loss of precision when `x[i]` is near a boundary. This explains why the optimizer fails to reach the expected value (11.1) when boundaries are set.\n\n2. **Line 931**: `double diff = boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i];`  \n   If `diff` is extremely large (as in the test case), subsequent division in line 932 becomes numerically unstable.\n\n3. **Lines 926-927**: `if (boundaries == null) { return x; }`  \n   The test passes *without* boundaries, suggesting the issue arises only when boundaries are enforced, though this is less suspicious than the normalization logic.\n\n4. **Line 930**: Loop iteration is correct but indirectly related to precision loss in per-element calculations.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    { "lineNumber": 952 },\n    { "lineNumber": 953 },\n    { "lineNumber": 957 },\n    { "lineNumber": 958 },\n    { "lineNumber": 956 }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    { "lineNumber": 958 },\n    { "lineNumber": 957 },\n    { "lineNumber": 952 },\n    { "lineNumber": 956 },\n    { "lineNumber": 955 }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 992\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 995\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 986\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 991\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
