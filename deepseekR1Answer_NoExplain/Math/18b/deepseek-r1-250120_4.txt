The key issues are:\n\n1. **Lines 931-932**: The normalization formula `(x[i] - boundaries[0][i]) / diff` assumes `boundaries[0][i]` is the lower bound and `boundaries[1][i]` is the upper bound. If the boundaries array is stored in reverse order (upper first, then lower), `diff` becomes negative, inverting the scaling. This would cause parameters near the upper bound (e.g., 11.1) to be misrepresented in the normalized space, leading the optimizer to converge incorrectly (e.g., to 8.0).\n\n2. **Line 926**: The null-check for `boundaries` is correct but indirectly relevant since the failure occurs when boundaries are active.\n\n3. **Line 929-930**: Array initialization and iteration are syntactically correct but depend on the correctness of the scaling logic in 931-932.\n\nThe suspicion order prioritizes the scaling logic (932, 931) as the root cause, followed by boundary handling and structural dependencies.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 957\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 958\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 952\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 956\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 958\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 957\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 956\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 952\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 992\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 995\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 986\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 991\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
