If a non-positive value (e.g., ≤0) is provided, it could cause infinite loops or premature termination in iterative algorithms.\n   \n2. **Line 98 (`this.epsilon = epsilon;`):** Missing validation for `epsilon`. A non-positive `epsilon` (e.g., ≤0) could lead to incorrect convergence behavior in numerical methods relying on this tolerance.\n\n3. **Line 97 (`normal = new NormalDistributionImpl(p, FastMath.sqrt(p));`):** The normal approximation for a Poisson distribution is only valid for larger values of `p` (typically λ > 1000). Using it unconditionally for all `p` might lead to inaccuracies, especially when `p` is small. However, this is more of a numerical stability concern than a strict code bug.', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 94\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 99\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 98\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 97\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Line 94 (`throw MathRuntimeException.createIllegalArgumentException(...)`):**  \n   - The unit test `testMean` expects a `NotStrictlyPositiveException` when a negative mean is provided, but the code throws a generic `IllegalArgumentException` via `MathRuntimeException`. This is a direct mismatch causing the test failure.\n\n2. **Lines 99 & 98 (`this.maxIterations = maxIterations;` and `this.epsilon = epsilon;`):**  \n   - Secondary issues: No validation for `maxIterations` (should be > 0) or `epsilon` (should be > 0). While not directly causing the reported test failure, these could lead to silent errors in numerical methods.\n\n3. **Line 97 (`normal = new NormalDistributionImpl(p, FastMath.sqrt(p))`):**  \n   - Numerical concern: The normal approximation is invalid for small `p` (e.g., `p = 10` as in the test), but this is not the root cause of the current test failure. Still a potential accuracy issue.'}]
