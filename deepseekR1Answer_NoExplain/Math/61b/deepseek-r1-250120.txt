This indicates a mismatch in exception type.  \n2. **Line 93** (`if (p <= 0)`) is suspicious because the error message explicitly states the mean must be "positive," but this check allows `p = 0` (non-positive), which might not align with the intended validation.  \n3. **Line 97** initializes `NormalDistributionImpl` with `sqrt(p)`, which would fail for `p = 0` (allowed by the current check). However, this is secondary since the exception on line 94 would prevent reaching this line for invalid `p`.  \n\nThe unit test confirms the error occurs when `p = -1`, and the root cause is the exception type/validation logic in lines 93-94. The previous focus on lines 98-99 (field assignments) was incorrect given the new evidence.'}]
