This line throws the wrong exception type for invalid mean values.  \n2. **Line 93**: The condition `p <= 0` may be overly restrictive if a mean of zero is valid in some edge cases (though Poisson typically requires a positive mean).  \n3. **Line 97**: Initializing `NormalDistributionImpl` with a mean of `p` could cause issues if `p` is very small or zero (though this is secondary to the exception mismatch).  \n4. **Lines 98-99** (lower suspicion): Assignments to `epsilon` and `maxIterations` are unlikely to directly cause the reported error but are included for completeness.'}]
