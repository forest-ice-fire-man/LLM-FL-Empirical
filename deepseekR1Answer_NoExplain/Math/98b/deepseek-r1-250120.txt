This mismatch causes `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when writing to `out[row]` for `row >= v.length`.  \n   **Fix:** `new double[nRows]`.\n\n2. **Line 780** (Secondary suspicion):  \n   The loop iterates over `nRows` (correct), but if `out` were initialized properly, this line would be valid. Still worth checking for loop boundary conditions.\n\n3. **Lines 783-784** (Less suspicious):  \n   Inner loop iterates over `nCols` (correct for dot product), but a mismatch between `dataRow` length and `nCols` could cause issues. Unlikely given the error context.\n\n4. **Line 786** (Least suspicious):  \n   The direct cause of the exception (`out[row]` access), but the root cause is the initialization in line 779.'}]
