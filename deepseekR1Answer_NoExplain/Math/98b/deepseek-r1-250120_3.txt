This mismatch causes `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when writing to `out[row]` (line 786) if `nRows > v.length`.\n\n2. **Line 780:**  \n   `for (int row = 0; row < nRows; row++) {`  \n   If `out` is incorrectly sized (as in line 779), this loop will iterate more times than the output array can handle, leading to the exception.\n\n3. **Line 783:**  \n   `for (int i = 0; i < nCols; i++) {`  \n   While likely correct, an off-by-one error here could theoretically contribute to index issues, but this is less likely than the sizing issue in line 779.\n\n4. **Line 786:**  \n   `out[row] = sum;`  \n   This is where the exception is thrown (as per the stack trace), but the root cause is the incorrect initialization of `out` in line 779.'}]
