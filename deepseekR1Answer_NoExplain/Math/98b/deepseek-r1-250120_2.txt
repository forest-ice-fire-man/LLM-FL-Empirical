This is the root cause.  \n   - The test case uses a 3x2 matrix, so `out` should have length 3, but `v.length` is 2, causing an error when accessing `out[2]` in line 997.\n\n2. **Line 997** (`out[row] = sum;`):  \n   - This line throws the error directly, but the root cause is the initialization in line 991. Itâ€™s secondary in suspicion.\n\n3. **Line 992** (`for (int row = 0; row < nRows; row++)`):  \n   - The loop runs for `nRows` iterations (matrix rows), which is correct, but combined with the undersized `out` array, it exacerbates the issue.\n\n4. **Line 986** (`if (v.length != this.getColumnDimension())`):  \n   - The input validation is correct but unrelated to the error. Included as a lower-priority candidate for completeness.\n\n5. **Line 994** (`for (int i = 0; i < nCols; i++)`):  \n   - The inner loop iterates over columns correctly but is included as a low-priority candidate for potential off-by-one errors.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 779\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 779\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
