The root cause stems from **integer division** in the exponent term `-dim / 2` (line 183):\n\n1. **Line 183 Analysis**:  \n   When `dim = 1`, `-dim / 2` in Java evaluates to `-1 / 2 = 0` (due to integer division), making the term `(2π)^0 = 1`. The correct calculation should use floating-point division: `(2π)^(-dim/2.0)` → `(2π)^-0.5 ≈ 0.3989`. This explains the inflated result (1 vs. 0.3989).  \n   **Fix**: Use `-dim / 2.0` to force floating-point division.\n\n2. **Lines 184-185**:  \n   These lines depend on correct covariance matrix properties (determinant and exponent term). While not directly faulty here, they are included in descending suspicion order because a misconfigured covariance matrix (e.g., incorrect determinant calculation) could exacerbate the error. However, the test case uses a valid covariance matrix (σ²=1), so the primary issue is line 183.'}]
