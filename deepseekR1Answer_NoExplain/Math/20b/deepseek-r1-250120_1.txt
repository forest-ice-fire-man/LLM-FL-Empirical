The `repairAndDecode` method (lines 920-922) is responsible for ensuring parameters stay within bounds before decoding. The current implementation directly returns `decode(x)` without any repair logic. This omission causes the optimizer to produce out-of-bounds values. Line 921 is the most suspicious because it skips the repair step. Line 920 (method signature) is also flagged because the method\'s name suggests it should include repair logic, but the implementation does not match.'}]
