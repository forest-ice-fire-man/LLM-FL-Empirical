The `repairAndDecode` method (lines 920-922) is likely responsible for ensuring solutions stay within bounds. The current code returns `decode(x)` directly without any repair logic (e.g., clamping values to bounds). This suggests lines 921-922 (the `return decode(x)` statement) are faulty because they skip the required repair step, leading to unconstrained solutions. The unit test fails because the repair step is missing, causing the bounds violation.'}]
