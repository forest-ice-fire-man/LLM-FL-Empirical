The `repairAndDecode` method in the first prompt (lines 920-922) **skips the repair step** and directly decodes the input `x`. CMA-ES requires candidate solutions to be "repaired" (clamped to bounds) before evaluation. The missing repair logic in line 921 allows invalid values to propagate, causing the bounds violation. The test case is correct (it properly sets bounds), so suspicion remains exclusively on the code snippet\'s lack of constraint handling.'}]
