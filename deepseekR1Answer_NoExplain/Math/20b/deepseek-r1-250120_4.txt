This matches the test failure where bounds constraints are violated, as no repair mechanism ensures `x` stays within `upper[0] = 0.5`.\n\n2. **Line 920:** The method signature `repairAndDecode` suggests it should modify `x` to respect constraints before decoding, but the parameter `x` is declared `final`, preventing in-place repairs. This could indicate a design flaw in constraint handling.\n\n3. **Line 922:** The `decode(x)` call lacks any preprocessing/repair step. If `decode` assumes repaired inputs (e.g., for fitness evaluation), this would propagate invalid values, causing the bounds violation observed in the test.'}]
