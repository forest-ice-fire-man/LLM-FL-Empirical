This is the most likely cause of "Best point not reported," as the last evaluated point may not be the actual minimum.\n2. **Line 226 (`current = new UnivariatePointValuePair(u, ...)`):** Updates `current` to the latest point `u` regardless of whether it improves the solution. This decouples `current` from the best point `x`, leading to incorrect returns.\n3. **Line 235 (`if (fu <= fx)`):** The update logic for `x` (the best point) depends on this condition. If the comparison is flawed (e.g., due to incorrect sign handling in lines 135-137/220-222), `x` might not track the true minimum.\n4. **Line 152 (stopping condition):** The termination logic `FastMath.abs(x - m) <= tol2 - 0.5 * (b - a)` could prematurely stop iterations if miscalculated, preventing convergence to the true minimum.\n5. **Line 182 (`if (u - a < tol2 || b - u < tol2`):** Ensures `u` is not too close to the bounds, but overly aggressive clamping might skip the true minimum near edges (relevant to the test caseâ€™s step function).'}]
