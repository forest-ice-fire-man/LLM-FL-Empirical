The condition `tol2 - 0.5 * (b - a)` could prematurely terminate the loop if the interval `(b - a)` is small, even when the minimum has not been properly bracketed. This aligns with the test failure where the optimizer exits early without reporting the best point.\n\n2. **Lines 174-176** (parabolic step validity checks):  \n   The conditions `p > q * (a - x)`, `p < q * (b - x)`, and `FastMath.abs(p) < FastMath.abs(0.5 * q * r)` determine if a parabolic interpolation step is valid. These checks might incorrectly reject valid parabolic steps near the boundaries (e.g., near `minSin + offset` in the test case), causing the optimizer to miss the true minimum.\n\n3. **Line 229** (`checker.converged(iter, previous, current)`):  \n   If the user-defined `checker` is not properly configured (or null, as in the test case), the default stopping criterion (line 152) is used. However, the test explicitly sets tight tolerances (`1e-100`), suggesting a dependency on the default criterion being correct, which line 152 may violate.\n\n4. **Line 235** (`if (fu <= fx)`):  \n   The logic for updating `a`, `b`, `v`, `w`, and `x` when `fu <= fx` might fail to correctly narrow the interval around the minimum if the parabolic step or golden section step misidentifies the best point.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the code snippet\'s convergence logic and interval updates, which directly impact the test case\'s failure to locate the best point.'}]
