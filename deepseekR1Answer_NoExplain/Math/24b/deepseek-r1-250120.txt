This causes the convergence checker to compare suboptimal points, potentially returning a non-optimal result.  \n2. **Line 267:** The default termination returns `current` (last evaluated point `u`) instead of the best-known point `x`, leading to the "Best point not reported" error.  \n3. **Line 129:** Initializing `x` with `mid` (start value) without clamping it to the interval `[a, b]` may start the optimization outside valid bounds.  \n4. **Line 228:** The convergence check uses `current` (which might not be the best point) instead of explicitly tracking the best point `x`.  \n5. **Line 235:** The update logic for `x` when `fu <= fx` is correct, but if `u` is rejected (not better than `x`), the best point `x` is not preserved in `current`, exacerbating the issue.'}]
