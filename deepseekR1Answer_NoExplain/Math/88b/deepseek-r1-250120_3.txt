This causes incorrect zeroing of coefficients if other columns in the row have `1`, leading to the erroneous `0.0` value in the test.  \n- **Lines 334-335:** The calculation `getEntry(basicRow, getRhsOffset())` and the subtraction of `mostNegative` (which is forced to `0` here) may fail to account for non-standard RHS offsets or sign errors in degenerate cases.  \n- **Line 328:** `mostNegative` is derived from the RHS of an artificial variable row. If this row is incorrectly chosen (e.g., due to stale pivot states), it could corrupt the coefficient adjustment.  \n- **Line 333:** The ternary logic `basicRow == null ? 0 : ...` might mask missing basic rows (variables not in the basis), causing valid coefficients to default to `0` erroneously.  \n\nThe test error (`1.0` vs. `0.0`) strongly aligns with line 337â€™s logic incorrectly zeroing a valid coefficient due to overzealous checks on prior columns.'}]
