The root cause lies in:\n\n1. **Line 138 (`if (sign >= 0)`):**  \n   The condition incorrectly rejects cases where one endpoint is a root (e.g., `yMax = 0`), as `yMin * yMax = 0` triggers the exception instead of returning the valid root at `max`.\n\n2. **Line 141 (exception throw):**  \n   The exception is thrown prematurely before checking if either endpoint is a root. The code should first check if `yMin` or `yMax` is zero (or within tolerance).\n\n3. **Line 137 (`sign = yMin * yMax`):**  \n   This calculation does not account for floating-point precision issues (e.g., `yMax â‰ˆ 1.22e-16` in the test case, which is effectively zero but not detected).\n\n4. **Line 139 (comment):**  \n   The comment mentions checking if values are "close to zero," but no actual implementation exists. This missing logic directly causes the failure.\n\n5. **Line 133 (`yMin = f.value(min)`):**  \n   While valid, the lack of subsequent checks for near-zero values (after computation) contributes to the issue.'}]
