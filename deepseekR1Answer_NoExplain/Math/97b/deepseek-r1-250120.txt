The condition `sign >= 0` incorrectly rejects cases where one endpoint is a root (e.g., `yMin` or `yMax` is zero). This is the root cause of the test failure.\n\n2. **Line 139 (`// check if either value is close to a zero`):**  \n   The comment suggests there should be logic to check if `yMin` or `yMax` is near zero (to avoid rejecting valid roots), but no such check exists in the code. This missing logic directly causes the false exception.\n\n3. **Line 147 (`ret = solve(min, yMin, max, yMax, min, yMin)`):**  \n   The choice of `min` as the initial guess for the root might cause convergence issues if `min` is already a root (as in the test case). This could explain why the solver fails to recognize `Math.PI` as the root.\n\n4. **Line 137 (`double sign = yMin * yMax`):**  \n   Calculating `sign` via multiplication introduces numerical instability. For example, if one value is very small (like `1.2246467991473532E-16` in the error message), floating-point precision issues might cause `sign` to be misclassified as non-negative.\n\n5. **Line 141 (`throw new IllegalArgumentException`):**  \n   The exception is thrown even when one endpoint is a valid root, indicating flawed validation logic in the surrounding code.'}]
