This line is the most suspicious. The other entries (1636, 1644, 1648, 1660) are additional instances of the same exception pattern (`// XXX` comments suggest debug code), which could cause similar failures in other scenarios. The prioritization reflects:  \n1. **Line 1752** (directly referenced in the error),  \n2. Other `throw` statements in conditional branches related to boundary/step calculations, which may interfere with interpolation point initialization.'}]
