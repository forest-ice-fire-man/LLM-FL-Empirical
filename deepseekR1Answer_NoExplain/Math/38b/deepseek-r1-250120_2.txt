This exception is a development artifact that should be removed. Other `PathIsExploredException` throws (lines 1636, 1644, 1648, 1660) are also suspicious debug remnants that likely disrupt normal execution flow. These are prioritized in descending line number order (most recent code paths first) based on the test failure\'s direct reference to line 1752.'}]
