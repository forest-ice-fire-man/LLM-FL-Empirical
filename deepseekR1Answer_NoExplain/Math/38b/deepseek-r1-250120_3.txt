This exception is clearly debug/validation code that should not be present in production. While other lines (1636, 1644, 1648, 1660, 1710) also throw the same exception, line 1752 is:  \n1. **Directly referenced** in the stack trace.  \n2. Located in a code path triggered by the test\'s use of `maxAdditionalPoints = 47`, which likely exceeds the `2n + 1` threshold and enters the final `else` block (line 1744).  \n3. Part of logic calculating quadratic model derivatives, critical for constrained optimization.  \n\nThe other lines are ordered by proximity to the main failure and likelihood of being triggered in similar edge cases.'}]
