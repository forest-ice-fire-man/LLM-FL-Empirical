This line is the most suspicious. Other instances of `PathIsExploredException` (lines 1636, 1644, 1648, 1660, 1710) are also problematic, as they represent debugging assertions that should not be triggered in production code. The ordering reflects:  \n1. **Line 1752** (directly referenced in the error)  \n2. **Line 1710** (model setup logic with hardcoded exception)  \n3. **Line 1660** (index adjustment logic)  \n4. **Lines 1648/1644** (boundary condition handling with exceptions)  \n\nThe test failure likely occurs when the optimization algorithm enters code paths guarded by these exceptions, which are meant for debugging rather than production use.'}]
