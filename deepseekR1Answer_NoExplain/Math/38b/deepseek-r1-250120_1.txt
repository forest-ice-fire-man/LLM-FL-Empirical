The exception appears to be a debugging artifact meant to validate code paths during development but should not be present in production code. \n\nOther `throw new PathIsExploredException()` statements (lines 1637, 1644, 1648, 1660) are secondary suspects because:\n1. They are similar debugging artifacts.\n2. The test failure specifically points to line 1752, but other exceptions could cause failures in different scenarios.\n3. The ordering reflects the immediate failure point (1752) followed by other potential debug leftovers in descending line-number order. \n\nThe error message\'s instruction to "remove it from the code prelim (at line 1752)" confirms this line as the primary culprit.'}]
