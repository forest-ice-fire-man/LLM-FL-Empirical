The code comments (lines 460-470) describe a preconditioning algorithm to mitigate this issue, but **line 473 directly implements the naive cross-product formula without applying the described rescaling/preconditioning logic**. This is the primary suspect. Lines 469-470 (where rho and v3 should be computed) are likely stubs/placeholders with no actual implementation, making them secondary suspects. The discrepancy between the described algorithm in the comments and the actual implementation strongly points to line 473 as the root cause.'}]
