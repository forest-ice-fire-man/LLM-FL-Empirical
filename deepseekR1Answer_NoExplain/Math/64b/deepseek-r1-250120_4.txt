This is particularly suspicious given the numerical sensitivity of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. A stale `residuals` array might propagate incorrect values in subsequent iterations.\n\n2. **Line 395 (ratio calculation):**  \n   The `actRed / preRed` ratio directly controls step acceptance. If `preRed` is miscalculated due to numerical instability (e.g., near-zero `pc2` in line 389), this could cause premature termination or invalid parameter updates, leading to convergence on a slightly suboptimal point.\n\n3. **Line 333 (inner loop condition):**  \n   The fixed threshold `1.0e-4` might be too strict for some problems, terminating the inner loop before achieving sufficient precision. This could explain the small discrepancy in the unit test result (0.2578**19** vs 0.2578**33**).\n\n4. **Line 360 (delta adjustment):**  \n   The `delta = Math.min(delta, lmNorm)` logic on the first iteration might over-constrain the step bound if the initial `lmNorm` is underestimated, limiting the algorithm\'s ability to explore the parameter space fully.\n\nThe error signature (extremely small numerical discrepancy) suggests a floating-point precision issue rather than a logical flaw. The ordering reflects the likelihood of residual handling (342-343) and ratio calculation (395) being primary culprits in numerical instability, followed by control flow decisions (333, 360).'}]
