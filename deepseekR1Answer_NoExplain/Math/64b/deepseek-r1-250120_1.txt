This could lead to suboptimal convergence, explaining the slight numerical discrepancy in the test.\n\n2. **Line 360:** `delta = Math.min(delta, lmNorm);`  \n   Over-aggressive reduction of `delta` on the first iteration might limit the algorithm\'s ability to explore larger steps early, potentially trapping it in a local minimum close to the initial guess.\n\n3. **Line 395:** `ratio = (preRed == 0) ? 0 : (actRed / preRed);`  \n   Setting `ratio` to 0 when `preRed == 0` could mask valid improvements in edge cases, leading to improper step rejection and stagnation near suboptimal parameters.\n\n4. **Line 369:** `if (0.1 * cost < previousCost)`  \n   The arbitrary threshold (0.1) might not adapt well to all optimization landscapes, causing miscalculations of the actual reduction (`actRed`) and affecting step acceptance logic.\n\n5. **Line 328:** `diag[j] = Math.max(diag[j], jacNorm[j]);`  \n   Improper scaling of the diagonal matrix could distort the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter adjustment, leading to inefficient convergence behavior.'}]
