The negation likely violates the algorithm\'s intent, causing steps to move *away* from minima instead of toward them. This directly explains the numerical discrepancy in the test (wrong convergence direction).\n\n2. **Line 370 (`if (0.1 * cost < previousCost)`)**  \n   The threshold for computing `actRed` (actual reduction) is arbitrary. If `cost` decreases but not by a factor of 10, `actRed` remains unset (-1.0), leading to incorrect trust region adjustments and premature convergence.\n\n3. **Line 369 (`actRed = -1.0;`)**  \n   Initializing `actRed` to -1.0 when the cost reduction check fails could lead to invalid ratios (`actRed/preRed`) and unstable step acceptance logic.\n\n4. **Line 394 (`ratio = (preRed == 0) ? 0 : (actRed / preRed);`)**  \n   Division by `preRed` (predicted reduction) without safeguards against tiny values could amplify numerical errors, destabilizing convergence.\n\n5. **Line 338 (`oldX[pj] = point[pj];`)**  \n   If `permutation` indices are invalid (due to earlier bugs), this could corrupt state rollbacks during failed iterations, though less likely than the direction inversion.'}]
