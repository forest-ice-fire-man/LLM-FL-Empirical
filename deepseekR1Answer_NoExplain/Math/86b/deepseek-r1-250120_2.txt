Cholesky decomposition requires the *decomposed* diagonal elements (after subtracting squared terms) to remain positive. This check is premature and insufficient to guarantee positive definiteness during the decomposition process.\n\n2. **Line 144 (Secondary Suspect):** The loop `for (int p = q; p < order; ++p)` updates the lower triangle but might incorrectly overwrite data needed for subsequent pivot calculations. This could allow negative pivots to go undetected.\n\n3. **Line 138 (Tertiary Suspect):** `ltI[i] = Math.sqrt(ltI[i])` assumes the diagonal element is already positive after previous operations, but there\'s no check here to validate the *current* pivot value during decomposition (which could become negative due to earlier transformations).\n\n4. **Line 145 (Lower Suspect):** The operation `ltQ[p] -= ltI[q] * ltI[p]` modifies the matrix during decomposition. If this subtraction causes a diagonal element to become negative in subsequent iterations, there\'s no mechanism to detect it.\n\n5. **Line 122 (Marginal Suspect):** The symmetry check logic using `relativeSymmetryThreshold` could theoretically allow asymmetric matrices to pass if thresholds are misconfigured, but the test case suggests the primary issue is with positive definiteness checks.\n\n**Root Cause:** The test case matrix likely becomes non-positive-definite *during decomposition* due to negative pivots emerging from inter-column operations. The current implementation only checks the original diagonal elements (line 114), not the dynamically updated ones, allowing invalid decompositions to proceed silently.'}]
