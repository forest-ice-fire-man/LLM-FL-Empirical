The root cause lies in **line 114**, which checks the **original diagonal elements** of the input matrix for positivity. However, Cholesky decomposition requires checking the **modified diagonal elements** during the factorization process (after subtracting contributions from previous rows). The current check is premature and ineffective for matrices that become non-positive-definite **during decomposition** (like the test case).  \n\n**Line 138** is suspicious because it computes `Math.sqrt(ltI[i])` without verifying the updated diagonal value (post-subtraction). If the diagonal becomes negative during decomposition, this line would produce `NaN` instead of throwing the exception.  \n\nOther lines (127, 144, 105) are less likely but still relevant for secondary checks (e.g., symmetry enforcement, data mutation, or decomposition logic).'}]
