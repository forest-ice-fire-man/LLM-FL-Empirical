The key issue lies in how the eigenvectors from the eigenvalue decomposition of the bidiagonal matrix are selected to construct the V matrix:\n\n1. **Line 242** (`eigenDecomposition.getV().getSubMatrix(0, n - 1, 0, p - 1)`) and **Line 247** (similar logic in the `else` branch) likely select the **first `p` columns** of the eigenvector matrix. If the eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order (as is common in many eigenvalue decomposition implementations), this would select eigenvectors corresponding to the **smallest eigenvalues** instead of the largest ones, leading to incorrect singular vectors. The correct columns should be the **last `p` columns** (e.g., `n - p` to `n - 1`).\n\n2. **Lines 259/263** (in the `else` branch) involve computations with `singularValues[j]`, which could cause division by near-zero values if singular values are not properly filtered. However, the test case likely executes the `m >= n` branch, making these less relevant.\n\n3. **Line 268** (matrix creation) might propagate errors from incorrect `wData`, but the root cause is the eigenvector selection in lines 242/247.'}]
