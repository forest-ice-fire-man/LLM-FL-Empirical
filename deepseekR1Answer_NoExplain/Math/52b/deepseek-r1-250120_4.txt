Key issues:\n1. **Line 344 (`if (c == 0)`):** Fails to check for negative `c`, leading to `FastMath.sqrt(c)` on line 378 producing `NaN` when `c < 0`. This is the most likely root cause.\n2. **Line 332 (`beta = FastMath.sqrt(...)`):** The numerator/denominator could become negative due to numerical instability (e.g., catastrophic cancellation in the test case\'s large values), causing `NaN`.\n3. **Line 378 (`c = FastMath.sqrt(c)`):** Directly produces `NaN` if `c` is negative (unchecked after line 344).\n4. **Lines 353/359 (`if (c == 0)`):** Similar logic flaws as line 344 in secondary code paths.'}]
