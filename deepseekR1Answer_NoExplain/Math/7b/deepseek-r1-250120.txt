This misses other events that might now occur in the remaining interval (e.g., after a `sin` event, a `cos` event might be triggered in the same step but is not re-evaluated). This directly explains the test failure due to missed events.\n\n2. **Line 317** (`return orderingSign * Double.compare(...)`):  \n   The comparator for sorting events could cause instability in event ordering when integration direction is backward (negative time). While not the primary issue here, incorrect event ordering might lead to subtle scheduling errors.\n\n3. **Line 347** (`isLastStep = currentEvent.stop();`):  \n   If `stop()` is called prematurely (e.g., due to an event misconfiguration), it could terminate integration before all scheduled events are processed. However, the test error suggests missed events rather than early termination.\n\n4. **Line 370** (`remaining.stepAccepted(eventT, eventY);`):  \n   When an event triggers a reset, this line updates remaining events but does not re-check if they now occur in the remaining interval. This could leave stale event states.\n\n5. **Line 394** (`isLastStep = isLastStep || state.stop();`):  \n   If any event erroneously sets `stop() = true`, integration might terminate early. However, the test failure points to event scheduling, not early termination.'}]
