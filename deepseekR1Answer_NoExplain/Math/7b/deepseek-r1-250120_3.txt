This could prevent other events from triggering a necessary stop. The correct approach would use `isLastStep |= state.stop()` to ensure *all* events are evaluated.\n\n2. **Line 313 (SortedSet comparator)**  \n   The comparator uses `orderingSign * Double.compare(...)`, which might collapse distinct events at the same time into a single entry (since `TreeSet` treats equal comparator results as duplicates). This could cause missed events, especially critical in the unit test where sin/cos events are interleaved.\n\n3. **Line 396 (`isLastStep = isLastStep || Precision.equals(currentT, tEnd, 1);`)**  \n   Using `Precision.equals` with an ULP of 1 might fail to detect termination at `tEnd` due to floating-point precision issues, especially near Ï€ multiples (common in the test case).\n\n4. **Line 382 (`if (currentEvent.evaluateStep(interpolator))`)**  \n   After resetting the interpolator, `currentEvent.evaluateStep` might not re-detect the event in the remaining step interval if the event recurrence logic is flawed.\n\n5. **Line 392 (Loop over `eventsStates`)**  \n   The loop updates `isLastStep` and event states after the last event. If `isLastStep` was set prematurely (e.g., due to line 394\'s short-circuit), some events might not be processed correctly, leading to scheduling errors.'}]
