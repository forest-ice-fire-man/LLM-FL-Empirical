In the unit test, `dim` likely corresponds to the number of data points (40,000), resulting in a 40,000×40,000 matrix (1.6 billion entries). This is not feasible for heap memory.  \n\nLine 45 is suspicious because it populates only the diagonal entries of the matrix, suggesting the intended use of a diagonal matrix. However, line 43 still allocates a full dense matrix, which is wasteful.  \n\nLine 42 (`dim = weight.length`) is less suspicious but still relevant because it determines the matrix size. The root cause, however, is the dense matrix allocation in line 43.'}]
