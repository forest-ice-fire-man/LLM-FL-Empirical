When `dim` is large (e.g., 40,000 in the test), this requires ~12.8GB of memory (40k x 40k x 8 bytes). This is exacerbated by the loop in line 44, which naively initializes entries. The root cause is line 43\'s use of a dense matrix instead of a sparse/diagonal matrix for large dimensions. Line 44\'s loop is secondary but contributes to memory usage by forcing full matrix initialization.'}]
