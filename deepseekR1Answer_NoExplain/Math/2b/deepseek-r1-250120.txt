This overflow results in a negative intermediate value, leading to an invalid negative mean. The sampling logic (not shown) likely depends on this mean, producing nonsensical samples like `-48`. The fix is to cast operands to `long` before multiplication, e.g., `(long) getSampleSize() * (long) getNumberOfSuccesses()`.'}]
