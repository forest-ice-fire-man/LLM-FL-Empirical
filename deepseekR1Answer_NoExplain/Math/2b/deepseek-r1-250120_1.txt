This overflow results in a negative intermediate value, which propagates to an invalid mean calculation. The negative mean might indirectly affect sampling logic (not shown in the snippet) and cause invalid samples like `-48`. The fix is to cast operands to `long` before multiplication (e.g., `(long) getSampleSize() * (long) getNumberOfSuccesses()`).'}]
