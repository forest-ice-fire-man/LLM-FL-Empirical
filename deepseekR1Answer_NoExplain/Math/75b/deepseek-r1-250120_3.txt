The test adds `Long(3)` and `Integer(3)`, but when querying via `(Object) Integer.valueOf(3)`, the cast to `Comparable<?>` treats `Integer` and `Long` as distinct keys. This results in incorrect cumulative percentage calculations (1.0 instead of 0.5). The cast in line 303 fails to reconcile numeric-type equivalence, making it the primary suspect.'}]
