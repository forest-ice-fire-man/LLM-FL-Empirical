The unit test passes `Double.MAX_VALUE` and `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, which are far beyond 20 standard deviations (when `mean=0`, `standardDeviation=1`). This check fails to intercept these cases *before* calling `Erf.erf`, causing unhandled exceptions.\n\n2. **Line 132 (`else if (x > (mean + 20 * standardDeviation))`):**  \n   Similar to line 130, this check for the upper tail is too narrow. Extreme values like `Double.MAX_VALUE` would bypass the `try` block entirely if not preemptively handled, leading to uncaught exceptions in `Erf.erf`.\n\n3. **Lines 127-128 (`Erf.erf((dev) / (standardDeviation * FastMath.sqrt(2.0)))`):**  \n   Passing extremely large values (e.g., `Double.MAX_VALUE / (1 * âˆš2)`) to `Erf.erf` causes divergence in the continued fraction calculation (as seen in the error trace). This is the direct source of the `ConvergenceException`.\n\n4. **Line 129 (`catch (MaxIterationsExceededException ex)`):**  \n   The caught exception type (`MaxIterationsExceededException`) does not match the thrown `ConvergenceException` from the error trace, leaving the actual exception unhandled.\n\n5. **General Flow:**  \n   The root cause is the lack of preemptive checks for extreme values *before* invoking `Erf.erf`. Moving the threshold checks (e.g., for values beyond 20 standard deviations) outside the `try` block would prevent `Erf.erf` from being called with problematic inputs.'}]
