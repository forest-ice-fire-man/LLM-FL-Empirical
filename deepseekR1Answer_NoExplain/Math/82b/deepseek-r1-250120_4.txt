This can lead to division by near-zero values or inclusion of invalid negative ratios.\n2. **Line 84** (`if (ratio < minRatio)`) may prioritize negative ratios (from rows with positive `entry` and negative `rhs`), violating the requirement that ratios must be non-negative in valid pivot rows.\n3. **Line 80** (`final double rhs = tableau.getEntry(i, tableau.getWidth() - 1);`) retrieves the RHS value but does not validate its non-negativity, leading to invalid ratio calculations.\n\nThe test fails because the solver incorrectly selects a pivot row, allowing the objective value to exceed the expected maximum (10.0). The priority order reflects the likelihood of these lines contributing to the faulty ratio selection.'}]
