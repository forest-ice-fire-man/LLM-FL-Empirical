In the simplex algorithm, only **positive entries** in the pivot column should be used for ratio calculations to ensure valid pivots. This flaw could select rows with invalid ratios (e.g., negative or near-zero entries), causing the solver to diverge from the optimal solution (as seen in the test failure).\n\n2. **Line 84 (Secondary suspicion):**  \n   The comparison `ratio < minRatio` might fail to handle ties in the minimum ratio correctly. In the simplex algorithm, tie-breaking rules (e.g., Bland\'s rule) are critical to avoid cycling. If multiple rows have the same minimal ratio, the code selects the last encountered row, which might not align with the solver\'s requirements.\n\n3. **Line 90 (Tertiary suspicion):**  \n   Returning `minRatioPos` as `null` when no valid pivot row is found might not be properly handled upstream, leading to ungraceful failures. However, the test error suggests this is less likely the root cause here.'}]
