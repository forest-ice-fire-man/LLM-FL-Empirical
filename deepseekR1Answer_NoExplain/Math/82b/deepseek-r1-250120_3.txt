This violates the simplex algorithm\'s requirement to **only consider strictly positive entries** for the minimum ratio test.  \n\n1. **Line 82:** The condition `MathUtils.compareTo(entry, 0, epsilon) >= 0` incorrectly includes entries that are effectively zero or negative (due to `epsilon`). This allows invalid ratios (e.g., negative values) to be considered.  \n2. **Line 83:** Calculating `ratio = rhs / entry` for near-zero or negative entries leads to invalid ratios (e.g., negative or near-infinite values).  \n3. **Line 84:** Comparing invalid ratios (e.g., negative values) against `minRatio` (initialized to `Double.MAX_VALUE`) selects incorrect pivot rows.  \n4. **Line 90:** Returns a pivot row based on flawed logic, leading to an infeasible or suboptimal solution.  \n5. **Line 79:** The loop starts at `tableau.getNumObjectiveFunctions()`, but if constraints are structured incorrectly, it might skip valid rows.  \n\n**Fix:** Change line 82 to `MathUtils.compareTo(entry, 0, epsilon) > 0` to exclude non-positive entries, ensuring only valid positive ratios are considered.'}]
