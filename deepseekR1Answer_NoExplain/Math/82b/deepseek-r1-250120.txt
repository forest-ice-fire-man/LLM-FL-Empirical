The key issues are:\n\n1. **Line 82** (Most suspicious):  \n   `MathUtils.compareTo(entry, 0, epsilon) >= 0` allows near-zero *or negative* values due to epsilon tolerance. This violates the simplex requirement to **only consider strictly positive entries** in the pivot column. Negative/zero entries can corrupt the minimum ratio test.\n\n2. **Line 83** (Secondary):  \n   `ratio = rhs / entry` becomes unstable if `entry` is near-zero (due to line 82\'s over-permissive check), leading to extreme ratios that skew pivot selection.\n\n3. **Line 84** (Tertiary):  \n   `ratio < minRatio` might prefer negative ratios (from invalid negative entries allowed by line 82), which are not valid candidates for the minimum ratio test in simplex.\n\nFixing line 82 to use `> 0` instead of `>= 0` (with proper epsilon handling) would address the root cause.'}]
