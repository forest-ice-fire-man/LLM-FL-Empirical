The unit test passes `rate = -0.25`, which is invalid (elitism rate must be in [0, 1]). The lack of validation here allows an invalid value to be set, causing the test to fail (expected `OutOfRangeException` was not thrown).  \n2. **Line 49 (`final double elitismRate`):** The parameter declaration does not enforce validity constraints. While the actual validation logic should be in the constructor body, the absence of validation at the parameter level (e.g., via preconditions) makes this line suspicious in the context of the error.  \n\nThe analysis focuses solely on the original code snippet, as instructed. The test case demonstrates that invalid `elitismRate` values are not rejected, pointing to line 51 (assignment without validation) and line 49 (parameter acceptance without constraints).'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 63\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 64\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 63\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe error `OutOfRangeException` is not thrown when `elitismRate = 1.25` (invalid value > 1.0) is passed to the constructor. The code snippet does **not validate** the `elitismRate` parameter before assigning it to `this.elitismRate` (line 65). This is the primary fault. Line 63 (constructor definition) is also suspicious because it does not include validation logic for the `elitismRate` input parameter. The super constructor call (line 64) is likely unrelated to the error since the test focuses on `elitismRate`, not `populationLimit`.'}]
