Typically, `elitismRate` should be in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`. Passing an invalid value (e.g., `-0.5` or `1.5`) would cause logical errors when selecting elites. Line **49** (constructor parameter definition) is secondary, as input validation could also be performed there. The superclass constructor (line 50) is less suspicious if it inherently validates `populationLimit` and `chromosomes` (common in population-based classes).', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 51\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 49\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error occurs because the test passes an invalid `elitismRate` (-0.25), but no `OutOfRangeException` is thrown. This confirms the primary bug is **line 51**, where `this.elitismRate` is assigned without validation. The constructor should include a guard clause like:  \n```java\nMathUtils.checkRangeInclusive(elitismRate, 0.0, 1.0);  \n```  \nbefore assignment. Line 49 (parameter declaration) is secondary because validation logic should exist in the constructor body, not the parameter signature. The superclass constructor (line 50) is not directly implicated here, as the test explicitly checks for invalid `elitismRate`, not `populationLimit` or `chromosomes`.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 64\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe unit test `testConstructorTooHigh` passes an invalid `elitismRate` of `1.25` (exceeding the valid range of `[0, 1]`) to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The error message indicates that the expected `OutOfRangeException` was not thrown, implying the code does not validate the `elitismRate` parameter.  \n\nIn the provided code snippet:  \n- **Line 65** (`this.elitismRate = elitismRate;`) is the most suspicious because it directly assigns the unvalidated `elitismRate` parameter to the instance variable. There is no range check here to enforce `0 ≤ elitismRate ≤ 1`, which would trigger the missing exception.  \n\nNo other lines in the snippet are directly responsible for parameter validation.'}]
