The error indicates the code should throw an `OutOfRangeException` but does not.  \n\n1. **Line 51** (`this.elitismRate = elitismRate;`) is the most suspicious because there is no validation ensuring `elitismRate` is within the valid range (e.g., [0.0, 1.0]).  \n2. **Line 49** (`final double elitismRate`) is suspicious because the constructor accepts invalid inputs without argument validation.  \n\nThe superclass constructor (line 50) is not directly relevant to the error since the test failure is tied to the `elitismRate` parameter, not the population limit.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error occurs because the test `testConstructorTooHigh` expects an `OutOfRangeException` when an invalid `elitismRate` (1.25, which exceeds 1.0) is passed to the constructor. The code snippet does **not validate the `elitismRate` parameter** in the constructor (line 65). Since the constructor blindly assigns the value without checking its validity, the exception is not thrown, causing the test failure. The most suspicious line is line 65, where the invalid rate is accepted without validation.'}]
