The unit test passes a negative value (`rate = -0.25`), but no `OutOfRangeException` is thrown. This line directly assigns the invalid value without validation.  \n- **Line 49 (`final double elitismRate`):** The constructor parameter declaration does not include a validity check (e.g., ensuring `elitismRate` is in the range `[0, 1]`). The lack of validation at this point allows the invalid value to propagate.  \n\nThe unit test expects an exception when the rate is out of bounds, but the current code snippet does not enforce this constraint. The root cause is the absence of input validation for `elitismRate`, with line 51 being the most suspicious (direct assignment of an invalid value).'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe unit test `testConstructorTooHigh` passes an invalid `elitismRate` (1.25) to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The error indicates the constructor should have thrown an `OutOfRangeException` but did not. The root cause is **line 65**, where `this.elitismRate` is assigned without validating that `elitismRate` is within the valid range (likely [0.0, 1.0]). The constructor lacks a guard clause to check the `elitismRate` parameter\'s validity before assignment, which is the direct cause of the test failure.'}]
