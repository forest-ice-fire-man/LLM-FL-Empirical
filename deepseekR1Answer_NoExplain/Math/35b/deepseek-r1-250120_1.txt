The error message indicates an `OutOfRangeException` was expected but not thrown.  \n\n- **Line 49** (constructor parameter `double elitismRate`) is now the most suspicious because there is no validation in the constructor to ensure `elitismRate` is within the valid range (e.g., [0, 1]). This matches the test\'s failure reason.  \n- **Line 51** (assignment `this.elitismRate = elitismRate`) is secondary, as the lack of validation (line 49) allows invalid values to be assigned.  \n- **Line 50** (`super(chromosomes, populationLimit)`) is less suspicious but still included in case the parent class has side effects impacting validation.  \n\nThe test case itself (lines 79-83) is correct and not part of the analysis.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 63\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 64\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 65\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 63\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe unit test `testConstructorTooHigh` expects an `OutOfRangeException` when an invalid `elitismRate` (1.25 > 1.0) is provided. The exception is not thrown because:\n\n1. **Line 65** (`this.elitismRate = elitismRate;`) is the most suspicious: The constructor does **not validate** the `elitismRate` parameter against its valid range (0.0 ≤ elitismRate ≤ 1.0). This allows invalid values like 1.25 to be accepted silently.\n\n2. **Line 63** (constructor parameters): While the constructor accepts `elitismRate`, the absence of validation logic in the constructor (line 65) makes this line indirectly suspicious, as the parameter is not properly constrained.\n\nThe parent class constructor call (`super(populationLimit)` on line 64) is less suspicious, as the test failure is unrelated to `populationLimit` validation.'}]
