This is the most suspicious line because the test explicitly involves `Complex.ZERO`.  \n\n2. **Lines 313/317** (`q = real / imaginary` and `q = imaginary / real`):  \n   If `real` or `imaginary` is zero, these divisions would produce `NaN` or `Infinity`, propagating errors in subsequent calculations.  \n\n3. **Lines 314/318** (`scale = 1. / (...)`):  \n   A division by zero in these calculations (e.g., `real * q + imaginary` or `imaginary * q + real`) could produce `Infinity`, bypassing the `NaN` check.  \n\nThe root cause is likely a missing/incorrect check for `real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0` (line 304), allowing the code to proceed to invalid reciprocal calculations.'}]
