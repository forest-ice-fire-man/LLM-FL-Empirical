The check `if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0)` should detect zero and return `NaN`, but it is likely failing to trigger. This could occur if `real`/`imaginary` are not *exactly* zero (e.g., due to floating-point precision issues or a bug in `Complex.ZERO` initialization). However, since `Complex.ZERO` should have exact zeros, this line is the primary suspect.\n\n2. **Line 308** (Secondary): If the `isInfinite` flag is incorrectly set for `Complex.ZERO`, the code would return `ZERO` instead of `NaN`. However, this does not directly explain the `Infinity` result, making it less likely.\n\n3. **Lines 314/318** (Calculation Logic): If line 304 fails to catch zero, the code proceeds to calculate the reciprocal. For `real = 0` and `imaginary = 0`, this would involve division by zero (e.g., `q = imaginary / real` in line 317), leading to `NaN`, not `Infinity`. However, if there is a hidden edge case (e.g., underflow/overflow in `FastMath`), these lines could theoretically produce `Infinity`, but this is less likely than a logic error in line 304.'}]
