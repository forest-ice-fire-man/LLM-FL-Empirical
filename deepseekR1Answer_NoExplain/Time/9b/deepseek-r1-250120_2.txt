This violates the intended logic where the sign of `hoursOffset` should apply to the entire offset, but the minutes should retain their positive value (e.g., `-2, 30` should produce `-02:30`, but the code erroneously calculates `-2, -30`).  \n\n**Line 257** is also suspicious because it validates `minutesOffset` but does not check `hoursOffset` validity (e.g., allows `hoursOffset = 24`, which creates invalid time zones).  \n\n**Line 268** and **266** are less likely but still relevant due to arithmetic edge cases (e.g., overflow in `safeMultiply` or incorrect accumulation).'}]
