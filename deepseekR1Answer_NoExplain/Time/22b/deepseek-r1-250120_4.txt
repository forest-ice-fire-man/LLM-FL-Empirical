This causes the conversion to use the default ISO chronology, which interprets the duration relative to the epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). The test sets a fixed time zone (UTC+2), but the `null` parameters in line 222 prevent the chronology from aligning with this zone, leading to incorrect date field calculations (e.g., days/weeks/months being non-zero when they should roll up to hours). The test expects all date fields to be zero because the duration is designed to fit entirely in the time fields (hours, minutes, etc.), but the lack of proper chronology configuration causes the breakdown to fail.'}]
