The `BasePeriod` constructor at line 222 (`this(duration, null, null)`) passes `null` for the `PeriodType` parameter (third argument). In Joda-Time, a `null` `PeriodType` defaults to `PeriodType.standard()`, which includes fields like years/months/days. This causes the duration to be split into calendar-based fields (violating the test\'s expectation of a pure hour/minute/second/millis split). The fix would involve using a `PeriodType` like `PeriodType.time()` (time-only fields) instead of `null`. Line 222 is the root cause.'}]
