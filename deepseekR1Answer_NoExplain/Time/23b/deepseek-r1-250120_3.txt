This directly explains the error `expected:<[WET]> but was:<[Europe/London]>`.\n\n2. **Line 597** (`return map.get(id);`):  \n   If `id` is not found in the map, this returns `null`, which could cause unexpected behavior. However, the current error is more likely caused by an incorrect mapping (line 577).\n\n3. **Line 578** (`map.put("ECT", "Europe/Paris");`):  \n   The test maps `"ECT"` to `"CET"`, but the code maps it to `"Europe/Paris"`. This mismatch could cause future test failures even though it’s not the current error.\n\n4. **Line 583** (`map.put("MET", "Asia/Tehran");`):  \n   The test maps `"MET"` to `"CET"`, but the code maps it to `"Asia/Tehran"`. This is another discrepancy that could cause failures.\n\n5. **Line 579** (`map.put("ART", "Africa/Cairo");`):  \n   The test maps `"ART"` to `"Africa/Cairo"`, which matches the code. This is less suspicious but included for completeness as other lines may have issues.\n\n**Note:** The analysis focuses on the code snippet and the specific error provided (`WET` mismatch). Other lines are included based on mismatches between the code’s map and the test’s expected mappings.'}]
