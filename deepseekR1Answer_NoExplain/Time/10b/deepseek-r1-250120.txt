The `0L` base instant might resolve to a year where the partial date (e.g., MonthDay) is invalid. The code assumes `chrono.set` can safely handle all partials, but fails when the default chronology context (year derived from `0L`) cannot accommodate the partial (e.g., 2023-02-29).\n\n2. **Line 100 (Secondary suspicion):**  \n   The check `DateTimeUtils.isContiguous(start)` may incorrectly assume `MonthDay` is a "contiguous" partial (valid across all time), but `MonthDay` is inherently non-contiguous due to variable month lengths. This could allow invalid partial comparisons to proceed.\n\n3. **Line 105 (Tertiary suspicion):**  \n   Returning `values[0]` assumes the period calculation always returns a single relevant field (days), but this may not hold if the chronology or period type is misconfigured. However, the primary issue is upstream in line 104.'}]
