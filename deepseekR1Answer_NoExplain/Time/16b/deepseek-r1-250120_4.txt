When parsing only the month ("M"), the year defaults to `iDefaultYear`, causing the unexpected reset to 2000. The bucket should use the current year from `instantLocal` to retain the original year.\n\n2. **Line 711:**  \n   `bucket.computeMillis` applies parsed values, but if the bucket was initialized with an incorrect default year (as in line 709), this line propagates the wrong value to `instant`.\n\n3. **Line 705:**  \n   `instantLocal` is calculated using the offset from the original chronology. A miscalculation here could affect time fields, but the error is year-specific, making this less likely.\n\n4. **Line 720:**  \n   If `iZone` overrides the parsed chronology, it could cause unexpected behavior, but the test case explicitly sets `TOKYO`, which is preserved. Lower suspicion.'}]
