The root cause is likely in the iteration order of `ALL_IDS` (line 2542). If `ALL_IDS` contains time zone IDs with overlapping prefixes (e.g., "America/Dawson" vs. "America/Dawson_Creek"), the shorter ID will be matched first, leaving "_Creek" unparsed. The iteration in line 2542 should process longer IDs first, but there is no indication of sorting logic. This explains the malformed error at "_Creek". Other lines (2541, 2543, 2540) are less likely but still relevant to substring extraction and iteration logic.'}]
