Time zone IDs like "America/Dawson" (shorter) may be checked before "America/Dawson_Creek" (longer), causing a partial match. This explains the error message "malformed at \'_Creek\'" â€” the parser incorrectly matches the shorter ID, leaving "_Creek" unprocessed. The IDs should be sorted **longest-first** to prioritize exact matches.\n\n2. **Line 2543** (Secondary): The `str.startsWith(id)` condition allows partial matches if `ALL_IDS` are not properly ordered. A stricter check (e.g., matching the entire substring up to the ID\'s length) might mitigate this, but the root cause remains the iteration order.\n\n3. **Line 2544** (Tertiary): If an incorrect shorter ID (e.g., "America/Dawson") is set here, it would propagate an invalid zone, but this is a side effect of the iteration order issue in line 2542. \n\nLine 2548 (`return ~position`) is **not** the issue here, as the test case expects a valid parse (the error occurs due to a partial match, not a failed parse).'}]
