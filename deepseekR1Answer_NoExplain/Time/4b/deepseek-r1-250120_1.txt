The code fails to throw an expected `IllegalArgumentException` because:\n\n1. **Line 438:** The `if (unitField.isSupported())` check skips the insertion order logic for unsupported fields but still allows their addition. This is the root cause, as unsupported fields should likely be rejected outright.  \n2. **Line 437:** Retrieves the `unitField` but does not validate its support before proceeding.  \n3. **Lines 464-465:** The `Partial` constructor and `validate` call might not properly reject unsupported fields added via the skipped insertion logic.  \n4. **Line 456:** If the unsupported field is inserted at `i=0`, the array copying logic could allow invalid field orderings.  \n\nThe code should check for unsupported `DurationField` earlier (e.g., in line 438) and throw an error to match the test\'s expectation.'}]
