The `compareTo` implementation in the original code snippet (lines 227-228) incorrectly returns `1` when the *other* field is supported, violating the `Comparable` contract. This would cause incorrect ordering (e.g., treating all supported fields as "greater" than the current instance), explaining why the test fails to detect misordered fields. The core flaw resides in line 227 (invalid comparison logic) and line 228 (erroneous return value), with the method signature (226) and return paths (229/230) being secondary suspects.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 249\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 205\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 203\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 204\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 250\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 249\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 217\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 215\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 219\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 234\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
