This violates the `PeriodType` constraints, triggering the "Field is not supported" error. Key points:\n\n1. **Line 1631 (Highest suspicion):** Directly attempts to set the unsupported "years" field in the result Period.  \n2. **Line 1634:** Similar risk for "months" field if the `PeriodType` had excluded it (though the test case allows months).  \n3. **Line 1627:** The condition `if (years != 0 || months != 0)` assumes these fields are always supported, but they may not be in the provided `PeriodType`.  \n4. **Line 1628:** The logic to combine months into years (`months / 12`) is invalid when the `PeriodType` doesn\'t support years.  \n5. **Line 1624:** The initial `Period` creation with `type` might implicitly discard unsupported fields (like years), but subsequent logic contradicts this.  \n\nThe code lacks checks to ensure `years`/`months` are supported by the `PeriodType` before manipulating them.'}]
