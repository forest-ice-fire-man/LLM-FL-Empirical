The same applies to `months` (line 1634) if the `PeriodType` doesn\'t include that field. Lines 1628-1629 (month-to-year conversion) and 1627 (checking `years`/`months`) are also suspicious because they assume the `PeriodType` supports these fields. The code fails to validate whether the target `PeriodType` actually includes the fields it\'s trying to modify.'}]
