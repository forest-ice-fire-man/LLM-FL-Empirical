The code assumes the `PeriodType` supports years/months fields, but this is not validated. The root cause is in lines 1631 and 1634 where unsupported field operations are forced. The `if (years != 0 || months != 0)` condition (line 1627) triggers this path, and the calculations in lines 1628-1629 compound the issue by assuming year/month support.'}]
