This triggers the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n2. **Line 1628 (`years = FieldUtils.safeAdd(years, months / 12)`):**  \n   Splits `months` into years and months, but this is invalid if the `PeriodType` does not support **years**. Attempting to normalize into an unsupported field is a logic error.\n\n3. **Line 1629 (`months = months % 12`):**  \n   Adjusts `months` based on the assumption that years are supported. If years are unsupported, this calculation is incorrect and should instead keep `months` as-is (no conversion to years).\n\n4. **Line 1627 (`if (years != 0 || months != 0)`):**  \n   This condition assumes that years/months should be processed, but it does **not check if the `PeriodType` actually supports these fields**. This leads to unnecessary and erroneous attempts to adjust unsupported fields.\n\n5. **Line 1634 (`result = result.withMonths(months)`):**  \n   While the test case includes `months` in `PeriodType`, this line could fail if a different `PeriodType` excludes months. Itâ€™s a lower-priority suspect but still a potential issue.'}]
