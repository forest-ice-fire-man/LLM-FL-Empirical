The key issues are:\n\n1. **Line 224** (Most suspicious):  \n   The check `if (loopType.getRangeDurationType() == null)` over-aggressively throws an error when two distinct field types (e.g., era/year) both lack a range duration. This conflates "no range duration" with "duplicate field type."\n\n2. **Line 222**:  \n   The condition `types[i - 1].getRangeDurationType() == null` initiates the flawed logic chain that leads to the false duplicate detection.\n\n3. **Line 219**:  \n   The `compare < 0` check in the ordering logic might inadvertently allow invalid field sequences when combined with the subsequent duplicate checks.\n\n4. **Line 239**:  \n   Similar duplicate-check logic for ranged fields could mask issues in edge cases, though less directly related to this specific error.\n\n5. **Line 215**:  \n   The `loopUnitField` derivation might incorrectly characterize field relationships if duration types are improperly mapped.'}]
