If `selectChronology` alters the time zone (e.g., switches to UTC), the `instantLocal` value (derived from the original time zone) will be interpreted in the new chronology\'s time zone, leading to an incorrect `defaultYear`. This can cause the parsed February 29 to be assigned to a non-leap year (e.g., 2003 instead of 2004), triggering the error.\n\n2. **Line 710 (`int defaultYear = ...`):**  \n   Uses the modified chronology from line 709 to calculate `defaultYear`, propagating the error. The `defaultYear` should be derived from the **original** chronology\'s local time to match the input instant\'s context.\n\n3. **Line 708 (`long instantLocal = ...`):**  \n   While the offset calculation is correct, if the chronology is later changed (line 709), `instantLocal` (based on the original zone) becomes misaligned with the new chronology, exacerbating the year mismatch.\n\n4. **Line 715 (`instant.setMillis(...)`):**  \n   The exception is thrown here, but the root cause is incorrect data passed to `computeMillis` due to earlier lines. This line surfaces the error.\n\n5. **Line 719 (`chrono = chrono.withZone(...)`):**  \n   If the parsed offset conflicts with the chronology\'s zone, this adjustment could further destabilize the chronology. However, this is less likely to be the root cause compared to lines 709/710.'}]
