Line 210 (`yearOfEra = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR)`) fails to account for the ERA field, causing the year to be off by 1 for BC dates (e.g., returning `1` instead of `0`). Lines 213-214 are less suspicious but included as secondary candidates (e.g., `MONTH` adjustment or `DAY_OF_MONTH` handling).

In `Calendar`, BC dates are represented with `ERA = GregorianCalendar.BC` and `YEAR = 1` (for 1 BC). However, Joda-Time\'s `LocalDateTime` uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar where 1 BC is year `0`.  \n\n- **Line 199:** `int yearOfEra = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);`  \n  This line retrieves the raw year value (`1` in the test case) but does not adjust for the era. For BC dates, the year should be calculated as `1 - yearOfEra` (e.g., `1 - 1 = 0` for 1 BC). The code fails to check `calendar.get(Calendar.ERA)` and thus incorrectly treats BC dates as AD dates.  \n\n**No other lines are suspicious** because the month adjustment (line 202) is correct (`Calendar.MONTH` is 0-based), and the remaining parameters (day, hour, minute, etc.) are extracted properly. The root cause is exclusively the missing era handling in line 199.'}]
