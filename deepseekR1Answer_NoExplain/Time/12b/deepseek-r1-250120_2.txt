The root cause is **line 210**, where `calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR)` retrieves the era-specific year (e.g., "1" for 1 BC) but does not account for the era (BC/AD). The code fails to convert this to a proleptic Gregorian year (where 1 BC = year 0).  \n\n**Secondary suspicions:**  \n- **Line 212**: The `yearOfEra` value (incorrectly derived in line 210) is passed directly to the `LocalDate` constructor.  \n- **Line 213**: While `Calendar.MONTH` is 0-based and adjusted with `+1`, this is unrelated to the year error but is included as a common source of month-related bugs.  \n\nThe test case confirms the issue lies in BC date handling, which is exclusively tied to line 210. The other lines are less likely but included for completeness.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 199\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 199\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 202\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 200\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 207\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 204\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
