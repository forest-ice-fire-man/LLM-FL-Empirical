The code fails to subtract 1 for BC eras, causing the year to be off by 1. This is the root cause.  \n\n2. **Line 212-214**:  \n   - Lower suspicion. The month adjustment (`+1`) is correct (Calendar.MONTH is 0-based), and the day extraction is valid. These lines are included for completeness but are unlikely culprits.  \n\nThe test case explicitly sets `cal.set(Calendar.ERA, GregorianCalendar.BC)`, but the code snippet from the first prompt does *not* account for the era when extracting the year (line 210).'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 199\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 199\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 201\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 202\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 207\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 200\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
