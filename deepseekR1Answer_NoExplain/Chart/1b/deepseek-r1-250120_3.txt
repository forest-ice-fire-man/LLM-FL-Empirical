The code **returns early when a valid dataset exists**, skipping legend item generation. This directly explains the test failure (expected 1 legend item, got 0). This is the root cause.\n\n2. **Line 1798 (`return result`)**  \n   The premature return statement prevents the logic for adding legend items from executing when a valid dataset is present.\n\n3. **Line 1800 (`int seriesCount = dataset.getRowCount()`)**  \n   If `dataset.getRowCount()` incorrectly returns 0 (e.g., due to dataset initialization issues), no legend items would be generated. However, the test explicitly adds data, so this is secondary.\n\n4. **Lines 1802/1812 (loop conditions)**  \n   If `seriesCount` is miscalculated (e.g., due to row/column confusion in the dataset), the loops might not iterate. This is less likely but worth noting.'}]
