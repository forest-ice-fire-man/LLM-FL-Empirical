The logic is inverted - it returns an empty collection *when the dataset exists*, preventing legend item generation. This matches the test failure where the dataset is populated but no legend items are created. The correct condition should be `if (dataset == null)`.\n\n2. **Line 1800** (`int seriesCount = dataset.getRowCount();`):  \n   If `dataset` is empty (e.g., before adding data), `seriesCount` would be 0, causing the loops to skip. However, this line only becomes relevant after fixing line 1797.\n\n3. **Lines 1802/1812** (loop conditions):  \n   If `seriesCount` is miscalculated (e.g., using `getRowCount()` instead of `getColumnCount()` for the dataset structure), the loops might not iterate properly. This is speculative but worth investigating.\n\n4. **Line 1795** (`int index = this.plot.getIndexOf(this);`):  \n   If the index is incorrectly retrieved (e.g., returns -1), `dataset` would be `null`, but the test explicitly sets the renderer to the plot, making this less likely.'}]
