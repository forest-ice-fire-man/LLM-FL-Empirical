This directly explains the test failure where different paths are incorrectly reported as equal.  \n2. **Line 288:** `Arrays.equals(d1, d2)` compares all 6 elements of the segment data arrays, even when the segment type (e.g., `LINE_TO`) uses fewer elements. Residual data in unused array slots could cause false negatives.  \n3. **Line 278:** Initializing `done` as `iterator1.isDone() && iterator2.isDone()` is correct, but if the loop logic were flawed (e.g., short-circuiting), it could cause issues. Lower suspicion.  \n4. **Lines 283-284:** While retrieving segments, if `currentSegment` has side effects or incorrect usage (though unlikely), it could contribute to mismatches. Low suspicion, included for completeness.'}]
