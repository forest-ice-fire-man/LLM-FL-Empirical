In JFreeChart, plots typically register as listeners to their dataset to receive change notifications. The assignment `this.dataset = dataset` does not include listener registration, leading to the test failure.\n\n2. **Line 146 (`PiePlot piePlot = new PiePlot(null)`):**  \n   The `PiePlot` is initialized with a `null` dataset. If the `MultiplePiePlot` is intended to delegate data to this subplot, passing `null` may leave the `PiePlot` disconnected from the dataset, causing unexpected behavior (though this is less directly related to the listener test failure).\n\n3. **Line 157 (`this.sectionPaints = new HashMap()`):**  \n   The `HashMap` is initialized without specifying generics (e.g., `HashMap<K,V>`). While this is not a runtime error, it may cause unchecked type warnings or unexpected behavior if the map is later used incorrectly.'}]
