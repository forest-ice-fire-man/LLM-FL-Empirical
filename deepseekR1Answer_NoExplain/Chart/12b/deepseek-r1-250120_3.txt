The error suggests the dataset does **not** have the plot as a listener after construction. In the provided code snippet:\n\n1. **Line 145 (`this.dataset = dataset`)**: This assigns the dataset but does **not** register the plot as a listener (via `dataset.addChangeListener(this)`), which is the direct cause of the test failure. This is the most suspicious line.  \n2. **Line 146 (`PiePlot piePlot = new PiePlot(null)`)**: Using `null` for the dataset in `PiePlot` might cause issues if the pie chart expects a valid dataset.  \n3. **Line 157 (`this.sectionPaints = new HashMap()`)**: Raw `HashMap` usage (without generics) could cause type-safety issues, though unrelated to the test failure.  \n4. **Line 150 (`this.pieChart.setBackgroundPaint(null)`)**: Setting a `null` background might trigger rendering issues, but not the listener error.  \n5. **Line 149 (`this.dataExtractOrder = TableOrder.BY_COLUMN`)**: Incorrect data extraction order could cause data misalignment, but again, unrelated to the listener registration.  \n\nThe primary issue is the missing listener registration in line 145.'}]
