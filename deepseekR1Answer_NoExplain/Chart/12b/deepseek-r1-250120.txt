In the provided code snippet:\n\n1. **Line 145 (`this.dataset = dataset`):** The most likely culprit. The constructor accepts a `dataset` but does not register the plot as a listener to it (via `dataset.addChangeListener(this)` or similar). This directly explains why `dataset.hasListener(plot)` returns `false` in the test.  \n2. **Line 157 (`this.sectionPaints = new HashMap()`):** Raw use of `HashMap` without generics could cause type-safety issues, though this is unrelated to the test failure.  \n3. **Line 146 (`PiePlot piePlot = new PiePlot(null)`):** Initializing `PiePlot` with `null` dataset might cause unexpected behavior in edge cases.  \n4. **Line 150 (`this.pieChart.setBackgroundPaint(null)`):** Setting a `null` background paint might lead to rendering issues but does not affect listener registration.  \n5. **Line 149 (`this.dataExtractOrder = TableOrder.BY_COLUMN`):** Incorrect data extraction order could affect data parsing but is unrelated to the listener registration error.  \n\nThe primary issue is **line 145**, as the plot fails to register itself as a listener to the provided dataset during construction.'}]
