The root cause is in **line 126**: `(value - this.lowerBound)` uses the original (unclamped) `value` instead of the clamped `v` (from lines 124-125). This allows negative values (e.g., `value = -0.5`) or values exceeding `upperBound` (e.g., `value = 1.5`) to produce invalid `g` values.  \n\n- **Line 126** (most suspicious): Should use `v` instead of `value` to ensure clamped values are used in the calculation.  \n- **Lines 124-125** (less suspicious): While they clamp `v` correctly, their results are unused in the critical calculation (line 126).  \n- **Line 127** (minor): Part of the calculation in line 126 but not the root cause.  \n\nThe fix is to replace `value` with `v` in line 126.'}]
