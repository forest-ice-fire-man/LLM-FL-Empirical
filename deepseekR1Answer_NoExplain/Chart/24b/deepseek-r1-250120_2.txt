For values outside the `[lowerBound, upperBound]` range (e.g., `value = -0.5`), `(value - lowerBound)` becomes negative, resulting in a negative `g` value. This violates the `Color` constructor\'s requirement that RGB values be in `[0, 255]`. The correct calculation should use `v` (the clamped value) instead of `value` in line 126.'}]
