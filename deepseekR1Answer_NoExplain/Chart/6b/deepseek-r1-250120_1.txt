The `equals` method relies on `super.equals(obj)`, which (assuming `ShapeList` extends a class like `Object` or a parent class without a proper `equals` override) performs a reference equality check. After deserialization, `l1` and `l2` are distinct objects, so this check fails. The correct implementation should compare the **contents** of the `ShapeList` (e.g., the shapes in the list) instead of delegating to `super.equals`.\n\n2. **Line 108 (`if (!(obj instanceof ShapeList)) {`):**  \n   While syntactically correct, this line may mask issues if `ShapeList` is part of a class hierarchy. For example, if `ShapeList` is a subclass of another list type (e.g., `AbstractList`), this check might exclude valid equality comparisons with subclasses. However, this is less likely to be the root cause here.\n\n3. **Line 105 (`if (obj == this) {`):**  \n   This line is technically correct but becomes redundant if `super.equals(obj)` is not overridden. If `super.equals` already checks for reference equality (as in `Object`), this line adds no value. However, itâ€™s not a direct cause of the serialization failure.'}]
