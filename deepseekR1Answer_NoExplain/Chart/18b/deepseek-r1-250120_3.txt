The condition `if (index < this.keys.size())` (line 318) becomes false after `keys.remove(index)` reduces the list size, skipping the index rebuild. This leaves stale internal state, causing failures when re-adding entries. Lines 316-317 (removals) are also suspicious because they assume synchronized indices but lack safeguards against concurrent modification. The priority order reflects this logic.'}, {'answer1': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 334\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 333\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```', 'answer2': '\n\n```json\n{\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 337\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 333\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 334\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
