In line 95, the superclass constructor is called with `paint` and `stroke` duplicated for both the main and outline parameters (`super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha)`). This means `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` parameters (from lines 93-94) are ignored, and the outline properties incorrectly inherit the main paint/stroke values. The unit test fails at line 297 because `getOutlinePaint()` returns `Color.red` (from the first `paint` parameter) instead of `Color.blue`.'}]
