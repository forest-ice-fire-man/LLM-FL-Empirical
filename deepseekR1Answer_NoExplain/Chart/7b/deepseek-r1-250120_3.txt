This causes the comparison `middle > maxMiddle` (line 305) to reference the wrong period (min-middle instead of max-middle), leading to incorrect updates of `this.maxMiddleIndex`. The test fails when a new period with a higher middle value is added, as the code fails to recognize the true maximum due to this logic error. The lines are ordered by their proximity to the root cause (wrong index reference).'}]
