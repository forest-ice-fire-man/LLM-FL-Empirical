This strongly suggests that the `cAvailableLocaleSet` variable was not initialized or populated before this method was invoked. The function assumes that `cAvailableLocaleSet` exists and is ready for use, but this assumption is incorrect, leading to the runtime exception. The root cause likely lies in the initialization logic for `cAvailableLocaleSet`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.'}]
