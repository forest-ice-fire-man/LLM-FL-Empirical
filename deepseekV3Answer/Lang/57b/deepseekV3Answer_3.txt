This is the primary issue and the most likely cause of the bug.\n2. **Line 222**: Although the error message does not explicitly indicate this as the cause, the function does not handle null `Locale` parameters, which could lead to issues depending on the implementation of the `contains` method in the set. This is a secondary concern.'}]
