The test expects `"String[]"` but gets an incorrect result.\n2. **Line 201**: The replacement of inner class separators might not be appropriate for array types or other cases where the structure should be preserved.\n3. **Line 197**: The search for inner class separators does not account for array types, which could lead to incorrect behavior.\n4. **Lines 184 and 187**: These checks are correct but could be optimized for efficiency. They are less critical compared to the array type handling issue.'}, {'answer1': '```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function is intended to extract the package name from a given fully qualified class name by finding the last occurrence of the package separator character and returning the substring up to that point.
