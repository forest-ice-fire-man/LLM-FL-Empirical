The issue arises when `array[startIndex]` is null, and the code attempts to call `toString()` on it. This is the most critical bug.\n2. **Line 3378**: Highlighted for potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to lack of bounds checking for `startIndex` and `endIndex`.\n3. **Line 3379**: Added as a potential issue because it does not handle the case where `startIndex` is greater than `endIndex`.\n4. **Line 3385**: Included because the loop assumes `endIndex` is valid, which could lead to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n5. **Line 3369**: Retained as a minor issue because returning `null` for a null array might not be the desired behavior in all cases.\n\nThe analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, as requested.'}]
