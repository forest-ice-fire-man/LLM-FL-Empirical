The issue arises when `array[startIndex]` is null, and `.toString()` is called on it.\n- **Line 3378**: The calculation of `noOfItems` is risky because it doesn\'t handle cases where `endIndex` is less than `startIndex`.\n- **Line 3385**: The loop does not validate array bounds, which could lead to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n- **Line 3369**: Returning `null` for a null array might not align with the expected behavior of returning an empty string.\n- **Line 3372**: Replacing a null separator with an empty string might not be the most intuitive default behavior.'}]
