The issue arises because the code assumes `array[startIndex]` is not null and attempts to call `toString()` on it. If `array` is null or `startIndex` is out of bounds, this will throw an exception.\n2. **Line 3378**: The calculation of `noOfItems` does not validate the indices, which could lead to incorrect behavior or exceptions if the indices are out of bounds.\n3. **Line 3385**: The loop does not validate the indices, which could cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the indices are invalid.\n4. **Line 3369**: While the function handles null arrays, the unit test suggests that this handling might not be consistent or sufficient in all cases.\n5. **Line 3372**: This line is less critical but could cause confusion due to undocumented behavior.'}]
