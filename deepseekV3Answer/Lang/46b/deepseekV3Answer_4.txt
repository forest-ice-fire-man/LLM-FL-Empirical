The test expects the input string to remain unchanged, but the function incorrectly adds an escape sequence (`\\\\/`), leading to the failure.\n2. **Lines 193, 195, 221, 223:** These lines handle Unicode escaping but are missing leading zeros in the escape sequences. While this is not directly related to the unit test failure, it is a potential issue for correctness in other scenarios.'}]
