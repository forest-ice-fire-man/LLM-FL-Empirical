The unit test expects a `BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS` error when overriding a private property in a different file, but the code reports a `PRIVATE_OVERRIDE` error instead. This mismatch indicates a bug in the error reporting logic for private property overrides.\n- The other issues (e.g., potential NullPointerExceptions) are secondary but still worth addressing to ensure robustness.'}]
