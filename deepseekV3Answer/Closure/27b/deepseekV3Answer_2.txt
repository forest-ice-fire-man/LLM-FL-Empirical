This indicates that `catchNode` is not a valid input for the `block` method, making this the most suspicious line.\n2. **Lines 231 and 232**: These lines perform validation checks using `Preconditions.checkState`. While they are not the immediate cause of the error, they could still be problematic if the input nodes are invalid.\n3. **Line 234**: This line constructs the final `TRY` node. It assumes that `tryBody` and `catchBody` are valid, but if either is invalid, it could lead to issues downstream. However, the error message does not directly implicate this line.'}]
