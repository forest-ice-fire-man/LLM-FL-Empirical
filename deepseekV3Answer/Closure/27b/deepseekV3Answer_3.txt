This suggests that `catchNode` does not meet the precondition for being converted into a block, which is the root cause of the `IllegalStateException`.\n- **Line 234** depends on the successful execution of line 233, so it is also flagged as potentially buggy.\n- **Lines 231 and 232** are less suspicious but still worth noting because they do not fully validate the structure of `tryBody` and `catchNode`, which could lead to issues downstream.'}]
