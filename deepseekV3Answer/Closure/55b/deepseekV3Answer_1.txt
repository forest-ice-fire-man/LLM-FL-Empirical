It only checks if the node is a function expression but does not include any logic to determine if the function expression is \'reduceable.\' This could be problematic if the function is used in a context where additional validation is required (e.g., ensuring the function expression meets specific criteria for reduction or optimization).\n2. **Line 116**: The method name `isReduceableFunctionExpression` implies that the function should perform more than just checking if the node is a function expression. The discrepancy between the method name and its implementation could lead to bugs or misunderstandings in the codebase. \n\nThe error message and unit test case provided suggest that the broader context involves validating function expressions in a compiler or optimizer, but the code snippet itself does not include the necessary logic to fully fulfill its implied purpose.'}]
