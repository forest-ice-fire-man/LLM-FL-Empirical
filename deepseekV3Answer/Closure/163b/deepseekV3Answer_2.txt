The function appears to be transforming these methods into stub methods, which is not the expected behavior. The fault localization focuses on the parts of the code that handle property accesses and object literals, as these are likely responsible for the incorrect transformation of prototype methods. The most suspicious lines are those that process properties and prototype-related logic, as they are directly related to the issue observed in the test case.'}, {'answer1': '```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function `isGlobalFunctionDeclaration` is intended to determine whether a given node `n` represents a function declaration in the global scope.
