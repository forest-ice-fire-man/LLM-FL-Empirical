The unit test case shows that such variables should not trigger this error, suggesting that the logic for determining valid aliases or local variables is flawed.\n2. **Secondary Faults (Lines 356, 366, 368, 385):** These lines remain suspicious due to potential `NullPointerException` issues, as previously identified. However, they are secondary to the primary fault related to the incorrect error reporting.'}]
