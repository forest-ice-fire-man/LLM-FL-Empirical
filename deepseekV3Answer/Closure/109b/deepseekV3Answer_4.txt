The error message indicates that `parseTypeName` is failing to recognize the type due to a syntax error, suggesting that `parseContextTypeExpression` should handle this case more gracefully.\n2. **Line 1907**: The function signature does not include any mechanism to validate the input `token` or handle potential errors. This lack of validation could lead to issues when the token is malformed or incompatible with the expected syntax.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the code snippet from the first prompt, and the fault localization is based on the error message and the context provided by the unit test case. The unit test case itself is not analyzed, as per the instructions.'}]
