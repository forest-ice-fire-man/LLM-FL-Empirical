The column number (`charno`) is likely causing the mismatch.\n- The `fixupSourceLocation` function (line 130) could also be a source of inconsistency if it modifies the `sourceFile` in an unexpected way.\n- The retrieval of `originalName` (line 132) might lead to issues if the property is missing or null.\n- The check on line 126 ensures that nodes without sufficient information are skipped, but it does not handle invalid `charno` values, which could affect the mapping.\n- The `generator.addMapping` method (line 139) is the final step in creating the source map, and any inconsistencies in its input parameters could lead to incorrect output.'}]
