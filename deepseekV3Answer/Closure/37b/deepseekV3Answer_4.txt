In the unit test, the function is incomplete (`function(e)`), which may not conform to this assumption, leading to an `IllegalStateException`.\n2. **Line 512**: The assumption that `n` is always a function is risky. If there is a parsing error (as indicated by the `PARSE_ERROR` in the unit test), `n` might not be a function, causing an `IllegalStateException`.\n3. **Line 533**: This line assumes `fnName.getNext()` will return a non-null node. In an incomplete function, `fnName` might not have a next sibling, leading to a `NullPointerException`.\n4. **Line 534**: This line assumes `args.getNext()` will return a non-null node. In an incomplete function, `args` might not have a next sibling, leading to a `NullPointerException`.\n5. **Line 540**: This line assumes `body` is a block and has no next sibling. In an incomplete function, `body` might not conform to these assumptions, causing an `IllegalStateException`.\n\nThese issues align with the `INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR` in the error message, which likely arises from invalid assumptions about the structure of the function node.'}]
