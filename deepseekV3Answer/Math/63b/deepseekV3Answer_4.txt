This contradicts the IEEE 754 standard, which states that NaN is not equal to anything, including itself. The unit test explicitly expects `false` for `NaN == NaN`, but the function returns `true`.\n2. **Secondary Issue (Line 417)**: The function also fails to handle the case where one value is NaN and the other is not. The condition `x == y` can return `true` even if one of the values is NaN, which is incorrect. This is a less severe issue but still a deviation from the expected behavior.'}]
