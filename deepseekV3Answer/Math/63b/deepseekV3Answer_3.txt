The test case explicitly asserts that two NaN values should not be considered equal (`assertFalse` on line 456), but the function returns `true` in this scenario.\n2. **Precision Issue with `==`**: While not the cause of the immediate test failure, comparing double values using `==` is generally unsafe due to precision limitations in floating-point arithmetic. This could lead to unexpected behavior in other cases where values are very close but not exactly equal.\n\nThe analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, as requested.'}]
