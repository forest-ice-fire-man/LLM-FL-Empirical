However, the unit test case explicitly expects `false` when comparing arrays containing NaN values (lines 456-457). This indicates a mismatch between the function\'s behavior and the expected behavior in the test case. The function should be revised to align with the test case\'s requirements, possibly by treating NaN values as unequal in this context.'}]
