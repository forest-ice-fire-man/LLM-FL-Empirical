These callbacks are critical for tracking evaluations and iterations, and any issues with their implementation could lead to runtime errors or incorrect optimization behavior.\n2. **Line 48**: The direct assignment of the `checker` parameter to the `checker` field without validation is a potential issue. If `checker` is null or improperly configured, it could cause failures in the optimization process when the convergence is checked.\n\nThe error message from the unit test case (`AssertionFailedError`) suggests that the optimizer\'s iterations are not being updated correctly, which could be related to the initialization of the `iterations` `Incrementor` object in the constructor.
