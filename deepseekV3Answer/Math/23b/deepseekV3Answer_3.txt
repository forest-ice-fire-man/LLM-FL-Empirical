The test `testKeepInitIfBest` expects the initial guess to be returned if it is the best point, but the current implementation does not explicitly ensure this. The conditions for updating the best point (`x`, `fx`) do not prioritize the initial guess, which could lead to it being overwritten even if it is the optimal solution. This is reflected in the fault localization, where the key lines responsible for updating and returning the best point are identified as potentially buggy.'}]
