If `preRed` is very small or zero, it could lead to numerical instability or incorrect results, which might explain the test failure.\n- **Line 347**: Initializing `actRed` to -1.0 might not be appropriate if it is expected to represent a positive reduction in cost. This could affect the accuracy of the ratio calculation.\n- **Line 312**: The loop condition `ratio < 1.0e-4` might be too strict, causing the algorithm to terminate prematurely or not iterate enough to achieve the desired precision.\n- **Line 380**: The condition `0.1 * cost >= previousCost` might not be suitable for all cases, leading to suboptimal step bound adjustments.\n- **Line 301**: The convergence check based on `maxCosine` might not be stringent enough, causing the algorithm to terminate before reaching the expected precision.'}]
