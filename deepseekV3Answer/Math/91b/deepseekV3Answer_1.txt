Floating-point arithmetic is inherently imprecise, and when comparing fractions that are very close in value (e.g., pi1 and pi2), the comparison may yield incorrect results. This is directly evidenced by the test case failure where `pi1.compareTo(pi2)` returns `0` instead of `-1`.\n- **Lines 259 and 260**: The conversion of `Fraction` objects to `double` values introduces precision loss. This is a contributing factor to the incorrect comparison results, as the exact values of the fractions are not preserved.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\nTo avoid precision issues, the comparison should be performed using integer arithmetic instead of converting to `double`. For example, cross-multiply the numerators and denominators to compare the fractions directly:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long thisNumerator = this.numerator * object.denominator;\n    long otherNumerator = object.numerator * this.denominator;\n    return (thisNumerator < otherNumerator) ? -1 : ((thisNumerator > otherNumerator) ? 1 : 0);\n}\n```\n\nThis approach avoids floating-point arithmetic and ensures accurate comparisons.'}]
