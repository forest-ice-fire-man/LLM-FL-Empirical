The test case involving `pi1` and `pi2` shows that the function fails to distinguish between fractions that are mathematically different but have nearly identical double representations due to precision errors. This causes the function to return `0` when it should return `-1` or `1`.\n\n2. **Lines 259 and 260**: The conversion of `Fraction` objects to `double` values introduces precision errors. This is a fundamental limitation of floating-point arithmetic and is the root cause of the incorrect comparison results. The test case explicitly highlights this issue by comparing two fractions (`pi1` and `pi2`) that are approximations of Ï€ but differ slightly in their double representations.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo fix this issue, the comparison should be performed using exact arithmetic (e.g., by cross-multiplying the numerators and denominators of the fractions) rather than relying on floating-point conversions. This would avoid precision errors and ensure correct results.'}]
