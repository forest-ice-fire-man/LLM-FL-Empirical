This is mathematically incorrect because SSE should always be non-negative. The issue likely arises from an incorrect implementation of the SSE formula. A correct implementation should ensure the result is non-negative, possibly by using absolute values or re-evaluating the formula."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
