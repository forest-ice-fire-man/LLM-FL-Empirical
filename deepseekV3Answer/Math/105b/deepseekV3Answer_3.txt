This violates the mathematical property that SSE must always be non-negative.\n2. **Division by Zero Risk**: The formula does not handle the case where `sumXX` is zero, which would result in a division by zero error. This is a potential runtime issue.\n3. **Unit Test Failure**: The unit test `testSSENonNegative()` explicitly checks that `reg.getSumSquaredErrors()` is non-negative, and the current implementation fails this assertion, confirming the issue with the formula.\n\nThe fault localization focuses on the formula used to calculate SSE, as it is the primary source of the bug.'}]
