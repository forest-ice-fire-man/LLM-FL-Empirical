The error message confirms this, as the result for `(48, 22)` is off by 1.\n- **Rounding Error**: Adding `0.5` before applying `Math.floor` is intended to round to the nearest integer, but this does not guarantee correctness due to floating-point representation limitations.\n- **Suspicion Level**: The issue is highly suspicious because it directly causes the unit test to fail for large inputs, and the error is consistent with floating-point precision problems.'}]
