This is likely the root cause of the error in the unit test.\n- The fault localization now explicitly highlights this issue as the most suspicious part of the code. The other potential issues remain relevant but are secondary to this critical bug.'}, {'answer1': '```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'guessParametersErrors\' is intended to calculate the errors of parameters in an estimation problem.
