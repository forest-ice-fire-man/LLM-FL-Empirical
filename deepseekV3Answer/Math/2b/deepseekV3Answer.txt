The numerator multiplies the sample size by the number of successes, which does not align with the standard formula for the mean of a hypergeometric distribution. The correct formula for the mean of a hypergeometric distribution is `(n * K) / N`, where `n` is the sample size, `K` is the number of successes in the population, and `N` is the population size. The current implementation suggests a logical error, which could lead to incorrect results, such as negative values or values outside the expected range, as indicated by the unit test failure."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n- The `getNumericalMean` function appears to be part of a hypergeometric distribution implementation, where the mean is calculated as `(n * K) / N`. However, the current implementation multiplies `getSampleSize()` by `getNumberOfSuccesses()` instead of using the correct formula. This logical error could result in incorrect calculations, such as negative values or values outside the expected range, as seen in the unit test failure (`sample=-48`). The formula must be corrected to align with the hypergeometric distribution\'s mathematical definition.'}]
