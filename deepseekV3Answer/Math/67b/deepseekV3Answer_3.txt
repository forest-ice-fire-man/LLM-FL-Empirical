This indicates that the `optimizer.getResult()` method is returning a value that does not meet the expected precision or accuracy. While the issue may stem from the `optimizer` object\'s configuration or internal logic, this line is the point where the incorrect result is propagated, making it the most suspicious part of the code snippet.'}]
