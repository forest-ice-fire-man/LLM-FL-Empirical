The **OutOfMemoryError** is primarily caused by the creation of a large square matrix (`dim x dim`) in line 43. For large values of `dim`, this can consume excessive memory, leading to the error.\n2. The loop in line 45, while correct in logic, becomes inefficient for large `dim` values due to the quadratic growth of the matrix.\n3. The code does not handle edge cases such as a null input array or an array with insufficient elements, which could lead to runtime exceptions.'}]
