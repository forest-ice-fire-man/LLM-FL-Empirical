The algorithm fails to converge within the allowed number of evaluations, especially for functions with sharp turns.\n2. **Tolerance Calculation (Line 211)**: The tolerance values (`1.0e-12` and `1.0e-22` in the test case) are extremely small, which can cause the algorithm to require an excessive number of iterations.\n3. **Root Estimation (Line 252)**: The `guessX` method may fail to produce a valid guess for functions with extreme behavior, leading to repeated attempts and exceeding the evaluation limit.\n4. **Fallback to Bisection (Line 277)**: Bisection is a slow method, and relying on it excessively can cause the algorithm to exceed the maximum evaluation count.\n5. **Precision Check (Line 155)**: The fixed tolerance in `Precision.equals` may not be suitable for all cases, potentially leading to incorrect root identification.'}]
