This is the primary cause of the unit test failure, where the expected result (1.0) is not achieved due to numerical instability.\n2. **Line 469**: The absence of code to compute rho, as described in the comment, prevents the preconditioning step from being executed, exacerbating the cancellation error issue.\n3. **Line 472**: The discrepancy between the comment and the actual implementation (using v1 and v2 instead of v3 and v2) indicates a logic error that contributes to the failure.\n\nThe analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, as requested.'}]
