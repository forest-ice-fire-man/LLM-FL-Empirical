The unit test shows that when `v` is an `Integer`, the method returns `1.0` instead of the expected `0.5`. This suggests that the `getCumPct` method is not correctly handling `Integer` values, likely because it treats them as distinct from `Long` values even though they represent the same numeric value (`3`).\n\n2. **Line 302**: The method signature accepts an `Object` type, but the implementation assumes it can be cast to `Comparable<?>`. This design flaw does not account for the possibility of `v` being an `Integer` or other numeric type that should be treated equivalently to `Long`. This leads to incorrect percentage calculations for non-Long types.\n\nThe root cause appears to be a lack of type normalization (e.g., converting all numeric types to a common type like `Long`) before calculating the percentage. This causes the method to fail when `v` is an `Integer` or other numeric type.'}]
