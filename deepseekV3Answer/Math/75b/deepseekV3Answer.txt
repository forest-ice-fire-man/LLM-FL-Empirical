The unit test error indicates that the calculation for `Integer.valueOf(3)` is incorrect, suggesting that the `getCumPct` method may not handle the object type properly or that the casting is causing unintended behavior.\n2. **Line 302**: The method signature accepts an `Object`, but there is no type checking or handling for cases where the input might not be comparable or where the object type affects the calculation. This could lead to incorrect results, as seen in the unit test case.'}]
