The **error message** and **unit test case** indicate that the constructor is being tested for handling negative mean values. The test case explicitly passes `-1` and expects a `NotStrictlyPositiveException`, which is correctly thrown by the constructor. This confirms that the validation on **line 93** is working as intended.\n2. The other potential issues (e.g., **line 97**, **line 98**, **line 99**) are not directly related to the error message or test case but are flagged as potential areas for improvement based on general best practices. \n3. The **intent of the function** remains unchanged, as the constructor is designed to initialize a Poisson distribution with validation for the mean value.'}]
