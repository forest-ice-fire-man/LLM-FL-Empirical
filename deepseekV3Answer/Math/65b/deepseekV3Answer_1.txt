If the weights are not properly normalized or do not represent the expected variance, the chi-square calculation will be incorrect. This directly explains the discrepancy in the unit test result.\n2. **Line 257**: If the `residuals` array contains incorrect values due to prior calculations, this would propagate into the chi-square calculation, leading to an incorrect result.\n3. **Line 256**: The loop condition depends on `rows`, but if `rows` does not match the actual number of data points or residuals, the calculation may be incomplete or incorrect.\n4. **Lines 254 and 255**: These lines are not suspicious and are included for completeness.'}]
