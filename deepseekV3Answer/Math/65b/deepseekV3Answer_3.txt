The discrepancy in the unit test suggests that the weights (`residualsWeights[i]`) might not be correctly applied or normalized, leading to an incorrect chi-square value.\n2. **Line 256**: The loop\'s correctness depends on the value of `rows`. If `rows` is incorrect, the calculation will be incomplete or incorrect.\n3. **Line 257**: The residuals used in the calculation might be incorrect due to a bug in the optimization process, contributing to the discrepancy.\n4. **Line 254**: The lack of input validation could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results, though this is less likely to directly cause the specific discrepancy observed in the unit test. \n\nThe analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, as requested.'}]
