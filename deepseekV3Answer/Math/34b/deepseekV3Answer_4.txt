The test expects this operation to throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`, but the iterator returned by `chromosomes.iterator()` does not throw this exception because the default iterator for `ArrayList` supports the `remove()` operation.\n- The issue lies in the fact that the `iterator()` method does not enforce the restriction on the `remove()` operation, which is likely a requirement for the `ListPopulation` class. To fix this, the iterator should be wrapped or modified to explicitly throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` when `remove()` is called.'}]
