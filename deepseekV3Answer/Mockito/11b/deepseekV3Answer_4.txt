A good hash function should distribute objects uniformly across the hash table to avoid collisions. Returning a constant value will result in poor performance in hash-based collections, as all objects will be mapped to the same bucket, leading to a linear search time instead of the expected constant time."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
