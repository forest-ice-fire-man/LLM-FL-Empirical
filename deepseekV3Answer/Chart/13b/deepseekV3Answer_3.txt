This directly points to **line 454**, where `constraint.getWidth() - w[2]` is calculated. In the unit test, `w[2]` exceeds `constraint.getWidth()`, causing the issue.\n2. **Secondary Faults**: The other calculations involving `constraint.getHeight() - h[0]` (line 437), `constraint.getWidth() - w[3] - w[2]` (line 462), and `constraint.getHeight() - h[1] - h[0]` (line 443) are also suspicious because they assume that the subtrahends are always less than or equal to the constraints. If these assumptions are violated, negative values could result.\n3. **Tertiary Fault**: The creation of `RectangleConstraint c5` (line 463) does not validate the values of `w[4]` and `h[4]`, which could be negative and cause further issues.'}]
