This approach fails to compare the internal state of the `ShapeList` object (e.g., the shapes stored in the list), which is essential for proper serialization and deserialization. The test failure indicates that `l1` and `l2` are not considered equal despite having the same content, suggesting that the superclass\'s `equals` method is inadequate.\n2. **Line 108**: The check for `instanceof ShapeList` is necessary but may not be sufficient if `ShapeList` has subclasses. For serialization, the equality check should ensure that the object is of the exact same class to avoid issues with inheritance.\n3. **Line 105**: The check for `obj == this` is correct but does not address the issue of comparing different instances with the same content, which is critical for serialization tests.'}]
