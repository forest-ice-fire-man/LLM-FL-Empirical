This causes the outline properties to be incorrectly initialized, leading to the assertion failure in the unit test (`expected:<java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255]> but was:<java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]>`).\n2. **Line 96**: While this line is not directly responsible for the error, it is included for completeness, as the `value` property is a key part of the `ValueMarker` class and should be verified for correctness.\n\nThe error in the `super` call is the root cause of the unit test failure, as it directly affects the initialization of the outline properties.'}]
