In the failing test case (pi1 vs. pi2), the double representations are equal (as shown by the unit test\'s delta check in line 180), but the actual fractions are distinct. This causes the comparison to incorrectly return 0 instead of -1/1. The correct approach is to compare via cross-multiplication (numerator1 * denominator2 vs. numerator2 * denominator1) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
