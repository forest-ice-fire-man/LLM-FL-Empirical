The **line 352 negation** is the most critical issue: reversing the step direction directly impacts the parameter updates, causing systematic drift away from the expected minimum. Fixing this line would align the direction with the intended gradient descent, resolving the test failure. The other issues (floating-point checks, scaling) exacerbate numerical sensitivity but are secondary to the direction inversion.'}]
