In the failing unit test, the compiler likely treats a valid type (e.g., a function type for \'toLowerCase\') as \'empty\' (e.g., due to isNoResolvedType() being true), causing it to skip property checks (like \'indexOf\'), thus failing to emit the expected warning. This suggests the OR logic is overly broad. If the intent is to check for a *truly* empty type (e.g., all \'no\' states), this should use logical AND (&&)."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
