This could be part of the issue described in the MockitoException.\n\n- **Line 89**: The `rawType()` method call implies that `returnTypeGenericMetadata` should be a class, but if it\'s not, this would result in a compile-time error.\n\n- **Line 88**: The `mockitoCore().mock()` call is suspect because `mockitoCore()` is not defined anywhere in the snippet provided. This line should either be imported correctly or replaced with a valid method call.\n\n- **Line 87**: The function `newDeepStubMock` does not appear to use its parameter `returnTypeGenericMetadata`, suggesting that it might be unnecessary or incorrectly implemented.\n\n- **Line 1 (Commented Line)**: The function declaration lacks a semicolon at the end and there is no closing parenthesis for the `mock()` method call, which are syntactical errors.'}, {'answer1': '```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function intended purpose is to configure and create a MockSettings object based on the GenericMetadataSupport object provided.
