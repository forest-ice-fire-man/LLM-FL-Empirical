Given the error message and the test case provided, it\'s noteworthy that the exact cause of the bug could also involve issues within the `recordDepScope` method itself, which is not visible in the snippet provided. However, since the prompt specifies that the analysis should focus on the given code and not the entire `recordDepScope` method, the fault localization is restricted to the relevant parts of the provided snippet.'}]
