The error suggests that the output of the function expects `"x- -0"`, but the actual output is `"x- -0.0"`, indicating that the function is not formatting negative zero without a fractional part, which is the expected behavior for negative zero.\n\nHere\'s the updated JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function \'addNumber\' likely aims to convert a double number \'x\' into its string representation, with special handling for edge cases, including the representation of negative zero.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 243,\n      "codeContent": "char prev = getLastChar();",\n      "reason": "This line reads the last character of \'x\'.
