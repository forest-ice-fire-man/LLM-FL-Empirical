It\'s suspected that the `setTagAsStrict` method may not be functioning correctly.\n- Lines 1477 to 1481 do not directly relate to the \'use strict\' directive issue according to the information provided. However, code at these lines should still be reviewed for any unexpected behavior, though it is less likely to be related to the reported error.'}]
