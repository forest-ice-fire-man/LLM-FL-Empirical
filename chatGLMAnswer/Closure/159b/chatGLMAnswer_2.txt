Fault localization usually results from a discrepancy between the expected behavior (as defined by the developer\'s intent) and the observed behavior. In this case, the discrepancy is inferred from the error message and the unit test case provided, and thus the analysis focuses on the inlined function transformation and how it might affect the code structure.'}]
