The root cause of this error is likely related to the handling of characters within the strings being checked.\n\n- Line 198 should be reviewed to ensure it does not mistakenly skip the check for the first character.\n- Line 199 might need additional checks for Unicode characters that can act as identifier starts but not identifier parts.\n- The function should be reviewed for any implicit assumptions about the input strings and their lengths.\n- The empty line 204 could be an indication of a coding error or oversight, and it should be addressed to maintain code readability and integrity.'}]
