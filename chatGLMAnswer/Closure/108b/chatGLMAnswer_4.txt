This exception typically means there is an invariant that was supposed to be true at runtime, but was not. Given the context of the error message and the code snippet, it seems the issue could arise from the inconsistent scoping or incorrect handling of variables within the `goog.scope`. The \'faultLocalization\' has been updated to reflect potential issues within the provided code snippet that could lead to the observed error.'}]
