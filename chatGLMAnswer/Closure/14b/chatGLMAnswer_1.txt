The unit test case has been constructed to demonstrate this issue. Here is the analysis focusing on the code snippet from the first prompt:\n\n```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The `computeFollowNode` function\'s purpose is to determine the next node in the control flow of a program represented by a tree of nodes.
