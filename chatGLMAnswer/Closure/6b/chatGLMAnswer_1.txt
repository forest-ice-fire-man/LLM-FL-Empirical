The relevant unit test case suggests that the intention is to warning about redefining a variable that is originally defined as an enum but later redefined as a constructor. Given the error message and the unit test case, the code at line 405 does not seem to be at fault as it handles redefinitions for constructors and enum types, which is what the test is trying to cover. However, the lack of redefinition checks elsewhere and the commenting out of `registerMismatch` are highlighted as areas that might contribute to the error. The analysis focuses on these aspects within the provided code snippet.'}]
