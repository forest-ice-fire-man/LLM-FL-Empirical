The actual issue cited in the error message seems to be related to a unit test failure in a `RemoveUnusedVarsTest` test case, which is not within the scope of this analysis. The error message suggests a difference in the expected AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) after some transformation or compilation step, possibly due to the incomplete logic in the provided `Assign` function\'s implementation.'}]
