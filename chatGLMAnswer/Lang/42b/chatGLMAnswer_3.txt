The current implementation appears to simply convert the numeric value of the character into a decimal string, which is not a valid HTML entity encoding. The correct approach would be to first determine the character\'s Unicode code point, write a reference to the entity starting with \'&#", then convert the code point into a hexadecimal string, and append it with a \';\'. The analysis focuses on the provided code snippet and assumes the presence and correctness of the `entityName` method for ASCII characters, while identifying the likely source of the issue with non-ASCII characters.'}]
