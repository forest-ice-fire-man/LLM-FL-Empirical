The explanation for line 73 includes the assumption that the block is related to the case where `index + longest > input.length()`, which is supported by the comments. The suspicion on line 80 is specifically due to the greedy search algorithm\'s logic and the subsequent error message, which indicates an unexpected codepoint consumption of 3, suggesting that the length returned may not match the intended longest substring match.'}]
