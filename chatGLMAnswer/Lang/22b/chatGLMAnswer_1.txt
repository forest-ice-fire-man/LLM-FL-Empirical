The code snippet from the first prompt does not include this method or the logic related to a `Fraction` class, but it is part of the `FractionTest` test case, and the error suggests that there might be an overflow or incorrect calculation of the GCD within that method.\n\nHowever, based on the context provided and the code snippet from the first prompt, the JSON object above focuses on the potential issues within the `greatestCommonDivisor` function itself. For a more precise analysis of the error, one would need to see the implementation of the `Fraction.getReducedFraction` method and its related tests.'}]
