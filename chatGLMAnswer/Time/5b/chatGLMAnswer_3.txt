The error message hints at a possible issue with the \'PeriodType\' being unsupported, but since the analysis is exclusive to the code snippet, the fault localization does not address the specific error message regarding \'PeriodType.setIndexedField\', which appears to be an interaction with other parts of the codebase outside the snippet provided.'}]
