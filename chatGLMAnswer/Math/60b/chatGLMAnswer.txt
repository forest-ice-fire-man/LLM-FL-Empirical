This suggests that the Erf function may be receiving an input that causes it to fail.

The analysis focuses on potential issues related to the cumulative probability calculation and the handling of extreme values. The issue with the `Erf` function\'s continuation fraction evaluation to NaN for infinity is specifically noted as a potential cause for the `ConvergenceException` mentioned in the error message.'}]
