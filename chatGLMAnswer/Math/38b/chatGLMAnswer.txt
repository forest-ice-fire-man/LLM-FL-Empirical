The error message suggests that there is an issue with revisiting paths (`PathIsExploredException`), which is consistent with the issue marked by the `throw` statement at line 1752. The unit test case indicates that there is a test failure due to the number of additional interpolation points, which might hint at bounds issues or incorrect calculations. However, since the focus is only on the code snippet itself, the analysis has been limited to those lines within the provided snippet.'}]
