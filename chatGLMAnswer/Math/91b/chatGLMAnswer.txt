The logical error on line 261 is the primary issue related to the error message, but other lines may also contain bugs that could lead to incorrect comparisons, including loss of precision in floating-point arithmetic and potential type safety concerns. The last item in the `faultLocalization` list refers to the unit test case, but since the instruction was to ignore the test case, it is only mentioned as a potential indication of a mismatch in expected vs. actual behavior.'}]
