The provided unit test focused on the objective function values for two variables and ensuring they are non-negative, which aligns with the reasons provided for suspecting lines 399, 414, 419, and 421 in the original function. Line 401 is flagged because of potential misuse of the `Set<Integer>` in comparison to the use case described.'}]
