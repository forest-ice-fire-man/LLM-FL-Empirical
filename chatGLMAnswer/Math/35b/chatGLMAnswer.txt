Since the constructor is not fully visible in the snippet you provided, we can only speculate what might be going wrong based on the information given.

Since the superclass constructor call is incomplete without its required argument, and the class parameter \'elitismRate\' is unverified for potential out-of-range values, these lines are flagged as the most suspicious. The empty line and the comment may not directly cause an error but are still noted for best practices in code maintainability.'}]
