This usually occurs when trying to store an object in an array of a smaller type. Given the fault localization we previously identified in the function\'s code, the most likely suspect from the code snippet provided would be the potential for a class cast exception to cause an `ArrayStoreException`. However, the error message suggests this might be a result of the `sample()` method returning an object that cannot be stored in the array of type `T`.\n\nConsidering the error message and the function\'s intent, the line that is most suspicious is:\n\n- Line 190: `out[i] = sample();`\n\nIf the `sample()` method does not always return an instance of `T`, or if `T` could be incorrectly defined such that it is not a superinterface of all possible return types of `sample()`, this would lead to the `ArrayStoreException`.'}]
