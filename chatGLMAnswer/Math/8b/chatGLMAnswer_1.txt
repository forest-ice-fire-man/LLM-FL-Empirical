Generally, you would not duplicate this kind of entry unless there\'s a distinct problem on that line. However, in this case, I provided two different reasons for why line 183 might be problematic, hence the duplication.

Given the context, the most likely cause of this exception is the incorrect cast from `Object` to `T[]` at line 187. This suggests that line 187 is the most suspicious in descending order of suspicion.'}]
