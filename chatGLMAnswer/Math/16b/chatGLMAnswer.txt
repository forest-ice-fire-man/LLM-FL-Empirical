Line 384 is problematic because it has a logical error due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic and will incorrectly return the value due to a NaN comparison.\n2. Lines 394 and 399 could cause numerical instability if \'x\' is within the range that might cause them to overflow or underflow.\n3. Line 405 may not cover all edge cases, as it doesn\'t handle negative infinity.\n4.
