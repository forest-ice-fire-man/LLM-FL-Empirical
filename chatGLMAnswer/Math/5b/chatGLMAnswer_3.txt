This discrepancy implies that the `reciprocal` function being tested is returning infinity for the reciprocal of zero, which is unexpected.\n\nGiven the code snippet, the line that is likely causing the error is line 305, where the function returns `NaN` if both the real and imaginary parts are zero. If this is the case, then the `testReciprocalZero` is correct and the issue is not within the provided code snippet but rather with how the `testReciprocalZero` test is written or with expectation of what `Complex.ZERO.reciprocal()` should return. The intended behavior of a reciprocal function on zero should indeed lead to an indeterminate form like division by zero (represented by `NaN` or infinity depending on the implementation). \n\nHowever, based on the snippet alone and without additional context, the potential bugs are in the conditional logic and the division operations as described above.'}]
