The most likely cause for this issue, based on the code snippet, is the missing parentheses in the line where `g` is calculated (line 127). If these parentheses are missing, the code will interpret `(this.upperBound - this.lowerBound)` as one large negative number instead of two separate subtractions, which will likely result in an incorrect calculation of `g` that is outside the range 0-255. The rest of the code then attempts to use this value to create a `Color` object, which throws the `IllegalArgumentException` if `g` is out of range.'}]
