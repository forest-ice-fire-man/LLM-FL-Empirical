It suggests missing quotes, presence of unnecessary escape characters, and the potential risk associated with raw concatenation into an HTML string.', 'answer2': '```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function `generateToolTipFragment` appears to be intended to create an HTML fragment that can be used as a tooltip.
