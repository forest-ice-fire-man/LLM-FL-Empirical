This causes the parser to stop prematurely, leaving "_Creek" unprocessed. The secondary bug in **line 2543** explains why the underscore in "Dawson_Creek" might not be properly handled (case sensitivity or normalization issues). The other lines highlight additional weaknesses that could cause edge-case failures.'}]
