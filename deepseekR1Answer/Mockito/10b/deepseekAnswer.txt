The `serializable()` setting is incompatible with classes lacking `Serializable` implementation or a no-arg constructor, which directly matches the error message. The syntax error (line 97) would prevent compilation, but since the test is failing at runtime, this suggests either the snippet was misrepresented or the syntax error was already fixed. The root cause is the forced serialization conflicting with the requirements of the mocked class.'}]
