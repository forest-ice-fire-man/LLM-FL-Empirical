Since `catchNode` is a CATCH node (not a block), this violates `IR.block()`\'s precondition checks.\n2. **Structural Inconsistency in Line 234:** The unit test expects a `CATCH` node containing `NAME e`, but using `catchBody` (a block) instead of `catchNode` strips away the exception declaration, causing the AST to mismatch the test expectations.\n3. **Validation Gap in Line 232:** While the check for `catchNode.isCatch()` is correct, it does not address the subsequent logic error of treating the CATCH node as a block source.'}]
