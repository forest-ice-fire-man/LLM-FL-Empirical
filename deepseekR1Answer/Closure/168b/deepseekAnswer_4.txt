The missing warning suggests:\n1. The `self` variable isn\'t recognized as escaping to the inner scope (line 2033 fault), so its type (`Foo`) isn\'t preserved in the closure.\n2. The method call `self.bar()` isn\'t analyzed for parameter types because scope-depth checks (line 1996) skip closure analysis.\n3. Property accesses (`self.bar`) aren\'t tracked across scopes (line 2025), allowing type mismatches to go undetected.'}]
