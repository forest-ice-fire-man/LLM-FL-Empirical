The existing type for `bar` is not updated with the new `valueType`, so no warning is emitted.\n- **Line 752**: If `@param {string}` is attached to the function value node but `defineInferredProperty` uses the key node (`bar:`), the type information from the JSDoc may not propagate correctly, leading to `valueType` being `undefined` or `unknown`.'}]
