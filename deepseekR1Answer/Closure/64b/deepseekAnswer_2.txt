The error `expected:<17> but was:<-1>` suggests the test found no additional directives (hence -1), conflicting with some other expectation. The root cause is line 1473: when processing **multiple inputs** with `ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT`, the current logic adds `\'use strict\'` to *each input\'s output*, resulting in redundant directives when files are merged. The test likely expects the compiler to deduplicate these, but the code naively tags strict mode per-file rather than globally.'}]
