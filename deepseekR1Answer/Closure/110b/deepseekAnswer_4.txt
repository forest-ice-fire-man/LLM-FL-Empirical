The code fails to alias `f` to `$jscomp.scope.f` because:\n1. Line 412 corrupts the AST by modifying the name node instead of the value, leaving `f` as a local variable.\n2. Line 358’s `isQualifiedName()` check excludes function declarations, skipping `recordAlias(v)`.\n3. Line 366’s `isVar` condition does not apply to block-scoped function declarations, bypassing the alias transformation logic.'}]
