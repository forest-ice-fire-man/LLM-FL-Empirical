This explains the slight deviation (0.257819 vs 0.257833) in the test.\n2. **Line 348**\'s hardcoded 0.1 multiplier fails to handle slow-convergence scenarios, causing inaccurate `actRed` values that mislead the step-bound logic.\n3. **Line 270**\'s reliance on `jacNorm` (never explicitly populated) introduces scaling errors, particularly problematic for problems like Jennrich-Sampson where parameter sensitivity varies.\n4. The strict convergence criteria (line 415) combined with floating-point inaccuracies in `actRed`/`preRed` prematurely halt iterations before reaching the required precision threshold.'}]
