The **inner loop\'s `step` parameter** is now confirmed as the root cause. The test case\'s eigenvalue mismatch (20654 vs. 16828) directly results from the array not being flipped when `step=4`, leaving the matrix in an invalid state for decomposition.\n2. The condition in line 1133 may use an invalid `pingPong` value (e.g., 1 instead of 0), causing incorrect comparisons and missed flips.\n3. The test case\'s array sizes (mainTridiagonal length 7) conflict with the hardcoded "4-element block" logic, suggesting a design flaw in handling non-multiples-of-4 dimensions.'}]
