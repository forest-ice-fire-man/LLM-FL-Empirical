Subtracting a small normalized direction vector from a large coordinate value leads to loss of precision, causing slight deviations in the computed direction. The correct approach is to negate the direction vector directly (e.g., \'direction.negate()\') and use it to compute the second point, avoiding arithmetic with large magnitudes."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
