This subtracts the direction vector from the reference point (a coordinate), producing a new point rather than a valid direction vector. The correct approach is to negate the direction vector directly (e.g., \'direction.negate()\'), ensuring the reversed direction is mathematically accurate. The current implementation introduces numerical instability because the resulting \'direction\' is derived from point subtraction rather than vector negation, leading to the test failure due to floating-point discrepancies."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```'}]
