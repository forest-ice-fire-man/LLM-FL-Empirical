Added null check failure as the top fault (matches the NPE in the stack trace)\n2. Prioritized integer overflow risks higher due to the test case\'s large coordinate values (325100/373200)\n3. Maintained array length mismatch as a secondary issue\n4. Removed redundant overflow comment about line 1627 (covered by line 1624/1626 analysis)'}]
