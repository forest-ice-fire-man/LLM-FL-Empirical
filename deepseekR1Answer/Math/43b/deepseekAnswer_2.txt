The condition `!(meanImpl instanceof Mean)` assumes that any `Mean` instance is the default implementation tied to `sumImpl/n`, but this is incorrect when the user explicitly provides a new `Mean()` instance. The new `Mean` is not connected to `sumImpl/n`, so it never receives data via `increment(value)`, resulting in `n=0` internally and a `NaN` mean. The root cause is the flawed class-based check instead of tracking the *default instance*.'}]
