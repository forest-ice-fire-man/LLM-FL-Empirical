This might not be the intended behavior, as `typeReference` typically deals with type information, not strings.\n2. **Method name and parameter list**: The method `applyAlias()` has a unique name and no parameters, which might suggest that it was created without careful consideration of its purpose or potential use cases.\n\nThese are just two potential issues, and there might be more depending on the specific context in which this code snippet is used.

This suggests that there\'s an issue with the type annotation in the code snippet.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided code snippet again, I notice that it contains a `typeReference` object and a method `applyAlias()`. However, there\'s no mention of the `MyType` or any other types being used or defined in this scope. The unit test case seems to be unrelated to this code snippet as well.\n\n**Updated Analysis**\n\nBased on the error message, I\'m going to assume that the issue lies with the type annotation mentioned in the error message.
