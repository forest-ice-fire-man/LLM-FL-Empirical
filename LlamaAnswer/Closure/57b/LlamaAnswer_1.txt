Potential null pointer exception when using `getQualifiedName()` on an object without checking its type.\n3. Potential null pointer exception when using the `equals()` method on two strings without checking for `null` values.\n4. Unlikely potential bug due to incorrect handling of boolean return value from `isExprCall()`.\n5.
