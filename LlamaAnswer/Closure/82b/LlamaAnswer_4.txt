However, as per your request, I focused exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt.\n\nAlso note that the error message you received suggests a warning about an issue (301) related to the `TypeCheckTest`. It seems like this is not directly related to the code snippet you provided. The test case `testIssue301()` seems unrelated as well, and I only considered it in the context of finding additional potential bugs.'}]
