If any of these variables are null, a null pointer exception will occur.\n* **Line 463**: The recursive call to `collapseDeclarationOfNameAndDescendants()` could lead to a stack overflow error if the function calls itself too many times.\n* **Line 459**: The code assumes that `n.props` is not null, but it\'s not checked.
