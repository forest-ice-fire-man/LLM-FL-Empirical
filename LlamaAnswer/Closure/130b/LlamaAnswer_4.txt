The fifth object has been added based on the unit test case, where it\'s mentioned that `collapsePropertiesOnExternTypes` is set to true, which might indicate an issue with extern types in the code.\n\nPlease note that this analysis focuses exclusively on the provided error message and unit test case, without considering any additional information. The codes in the \'faultLocalization\' array are listed in descending order of suspicion, but I\'ve prioritized them based on the severity of their potential impact.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!'}]
