The main reason why `copyInformationFrom` method may cause a problem here is that it is being used to copy information from one node to another, which might not always be necessary or safe. Also, there\'s a potential issue with the check for the catch node type (in line 232), as it might not cover all possible edge cases.\n\nNote: The codes in the \'faultLocalization\' array are listed in descending order of suspicion, as per your request. However, the actual bug might be related to the `copyInformationFrom` method or the check for the catch node type, which is harder to determine without more context.'}]
