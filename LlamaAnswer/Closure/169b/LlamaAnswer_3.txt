A more robust return statement or additional checks would improve the function\'s reliability.\n3. The use of `getLeastSupertype()` in line 209 might not be the most efficient or effective way to calculate the greatest subtype. Alternative approaches, such as using a more specialized algorithm or data structure, could provide better results.\n4. The loop in lines 196-198 iterates over a potentially large number of properties. This could impact performance, especially if the `properties` map is very large.\n5. The creation of a `UnionTypeBuilder` instance in line 199 might be unnecessary or inefficient in this context.
