The issue seems to be related to the comparison of function types.\n\nHere\'s an analysis of the code snippet and the added information:\n\nThe `testIssue791` unit test case is calling the `testTypes` method with a specific JavaScript code snippet. This code snippet defines a function `test1` that takes an object as an argument, where the object has a property named "func" with a function type.\n\nHowever, when comparing this function type to the expected type `{func: function(): ?}`, the `hasEqualParameters` method seems to be incorrectly identifying a type mismatch (`JSC_TYPE_MISMATCH`) and issuing a warning.
