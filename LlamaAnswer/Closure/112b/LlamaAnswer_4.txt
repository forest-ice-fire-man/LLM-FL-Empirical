The \'faultLocalization\' array contains JSON objects for each line of code that may lead to a bug or unexpected behavior. These locations are listed in descending order of suspicion based on the provided error message.\n\nThis updated analysis takes into account the original code snippet\'s intention and the potential issues it might encounter, focusing exclusively on the code within `<code>` tags from the first prompt.'}]
