However, since the unit test case has a warning related to block comment handling on line 695, we\'ll focus on that in the \'faultLocalization\' array.\n\nBased on the error message, it seems like the code is expecting a specific string in a comment but is unable to find it. This might indicate an incorrect logic or missing edge cases in the `handleBlockComment` function.\n\nSo, I\'ve added this issue as a potential bug with reason "Potential bug: The code checks for specific strings in a comment, but it might be missing edge cases or incorrect logic."'}]
