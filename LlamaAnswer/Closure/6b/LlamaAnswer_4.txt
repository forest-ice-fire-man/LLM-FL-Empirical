Potential NullPointerException at line 374\n5. Potential performance issue at line 373', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and unit test case, I\'ve analyzed the code snippet and updated the JSON object with the new information.\n\nThe issue lies in the fact that the `registerMismatch()` function is called instead of `mismatch()` in lines 367-381.
