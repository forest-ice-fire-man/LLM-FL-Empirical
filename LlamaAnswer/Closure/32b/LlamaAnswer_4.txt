The function iterates over each token in the JsDoc stream, and when it encounters an annotation with the type "@preserve", it extracts the textual block associated with that annotation.\n\nGiven the error message you provided, it seems that the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` function is not correctly handling multiline text blocks within the JsDoc stream. The expected output for the unit test case "testParsePreserve" was a specific formatted string with " Foo\\nBar\\n\\nBaz>", but the actual output produced by the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` function caused it to fail.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to how the textual blocks are being extracted and concatenated. Here\'s an updated version of the JSON object describing the intent of this function and potential fault localization:\n\n```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "The function extractMultilineTextualBlock appears to be intended for extracting multiline textual blocks from a JsDoc stream.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1362,\n      "codeContent": "builder.append(\'*\');",\n      "reason": "The star append might cause issues if the star should not be included in the extracted text."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1407,\n      "codeContent": "jsdocBuilder.markText(multilineText, startLineno, startCharno, endLineno, endCharno);",\n      "reason": "The method call might not be necessary or could cause problems if its parameters are not passed correctly."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1342,\n      "codeContent": "String line = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();",\n      "reason": "There is a potential issue if the getRemainingJSDocLine method returns null or an empty string, leading to incorrect extraction of multiline textual blocks."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1335,\n      "codeContent": "return new ExtractionInfo(\\"\\", token);",\n      "reason": "This return statement might be unreachable or unnecessary in certain scenarios, causing unexpected behavior."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 1351,\n      "codeContent": "if (currentToken instanceof Annotation && ((Annotation) currentToken).getName().equals(\\"preserve\\")) {",\n      "reason": "The condition for extracting textual blocks might not be met correctly or at all, leading to incorrect extraction of textual blocks."\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated JSON object, the \'faultLocalization\' array has been modified according to your request, focusing on the code snippet from the first prompt and listing the potential issues in descending order of suspicion.'}]
