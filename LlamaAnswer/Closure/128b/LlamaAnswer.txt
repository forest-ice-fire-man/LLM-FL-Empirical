However, when printing the output in a specific format, it appears that the function is not handling the case where the input string contains curly braces and a colon. In this case, the function seems to be returning an incorrect result.\n\nHere\'s an updated JSON object:\n\n```\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "Checks if a given string represents a simple number (non-negative integer)",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 789,\n      "codeContent": "return false;",\n      "reason": "Potential bug: The function is not handling the case where the input string contains curly braces and a colon."\n    },\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 787,\n      "codeContent": "if (c < \'0\' || c > \'9\') {",\n      "reason": "Potential bug: This condition may be incorrect if Unicode characters are involved.
