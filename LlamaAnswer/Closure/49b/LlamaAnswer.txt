These locations are identified as potentially buggy based on the error message and unit test case. The analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt.\n\nNote that I have added a new object to the \'faultLocalization\' array, which suggests that there might be an issue with the check for the renamer type in line 83. This is based on the fact that the error message mentions an incorrect renaming of the function `x`, and the test case seems to expect a different behavior from the function injector.'}]
