If this method fails or returns an incorrect value, it might lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.\n\n2. **Issue on line 1907**: The function is declared as private and not documented (assuming `JsDocToken` and `Node` are custom classes). This might lead to confusion or incorrect usage by other developers who rely on this method being public or exposed through a specific API.\n\nThese issues can be considered bugs because they might lead to unexpected behavior, confusion among developers, or even crashes if the calling code relies heavily on these methods.
