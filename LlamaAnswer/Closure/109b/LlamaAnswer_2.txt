Line 1907: The reason for this location being potentially buggy is because the function is private, which may indicate it\'s not intended to be used publicly and could contain implementation-specific logic.\n\n2. Line 1908: The reason for this location being potentially buggy is because the method only calls another method without any additional processing. This might suggest that the actual parsing logic is in `parseTypeName` and this function does not add much value.\n\nNote that these are potential issues and may not necessarily be bugs.
