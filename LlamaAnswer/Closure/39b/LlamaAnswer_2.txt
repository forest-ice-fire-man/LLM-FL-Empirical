The codes in the \'faultLocalization\' array are listed in descending order of suspicion based on the likelihood of causing errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nIn the context of the provided unit test case, these potential bugs may be contributing factors to the observed error message related to `ProxyObjectType` and `RecordTypeBuilder`.'}]
