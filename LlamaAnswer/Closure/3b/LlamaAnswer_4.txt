The comment mentions that certain cases can still be inlined.\n2. `313`: This line introduces a side effect check on the right-hand side of a definition. However, there is a TODO comment indicating that this check should be more accurate.\n3. `319`: Similar to the previous point, this line checks for side effects on sub-expressions left of a use. Again, the comment mentions that this check should be more accurate.\n4. `336`: This line checks that there is only one use within the CFG node and program. However, it\'s unclear why this specific condition would cause inlining to fail.\n5. `348`: Finally, this line checks that there is only one use of a variable in the program.
