However, there are several issues with the implementation.\n- In line 92, we return an instance of `RecordType`, which may not be correctly initialized with the given properties. This is suspicious because it\'s unclear how the properties will be used to initialize the RecordType.\n- In line 89, we return a native object type without considering if the record is empty or not. This may lead to incorrect results.\n- The condition `isEmpty` in lines 88 and 87 is not clearly defined. It\'s not clear why an empty record would return a native object type instead of the object type.\n\nNote: The fault localization array contains up to five JSON objects, each with three fields: lineNumber, codeContent, and reason.
