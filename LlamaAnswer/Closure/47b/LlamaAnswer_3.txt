The error message suggests that the source map generator is producing a different output than expected, specifically regarding the "mappings" section.\n\nUpon closer inspection of the `addMapping()` method, I notice that the line numbers and column numbers are not correctly handled for Rhino source lines, which are one-based but columns are zero-based.
