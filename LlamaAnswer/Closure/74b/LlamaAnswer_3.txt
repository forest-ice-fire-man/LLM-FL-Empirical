This might be optimized or replaced with a more efficient approach (e.g., using hash codes).\n3. **Line 1017**: The function uses the same expensive comparison operation as above, which can lead to performance issues.\n4. **Line 1030**: The function has an if statement with a condition that depends on the type of the right operand, which might be simplified or optimized for better performance.\n5. **Line 1046**: The function returns early without evaluating the comparison when the operands are not equal, which might be optimized by removing this unnecessary check.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and the original code snippet, I\'ll analyze the parts contained within `<code>` and `</code>` to identify potential issues.\n\nHowever, since you didn\'t provide a specific code snippet in the first prompt, I will use the JSON object provided earlier as a reference.
