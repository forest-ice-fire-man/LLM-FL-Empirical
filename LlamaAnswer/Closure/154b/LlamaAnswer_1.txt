The potential mismatch between the type of a property and its interface implementation (lines 1055, 1044, and 1047). This could lead to incorrect compilation results.\n2. The potential issue with missing @override for a property that overrides a superclass (line 1074).\n3. The potential mismatch between the type of a property and its superclass implementation (lines 1088, 1079, and 1076).\n4. The unknown override for a property (line 1095). This could lead to incorrect compilation results.\n5. The reportMissingOverride issue is reported when there\'s no @override present but the property does override an interface or superclass property. However, it\'s not immediately clear how this would result in incorrect compilation results without more context about what reportMissingOverride controls.\n\nNote: In descending order of suspicion, we prioritize issues that could have significant impacts on code correctness and are harder to track down. This means prioritizing type mismatches over missing @override for overridden properties, as the latter might be a design choice rather than an error in the code itself.'}]
