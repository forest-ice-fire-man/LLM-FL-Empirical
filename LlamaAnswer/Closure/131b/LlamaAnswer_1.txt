It seems that there\'s an issue with the `isJSIdentifier` function when it comes to quoted properties (strings). The code snippet doesn\'t seem to handle these correctly.\n\nHere\'s a new JSON object for this:\n\n```\n{\n  "lineNumber": 197,\n  "codeContent": "for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {",\n  "reason": "Inadequate handling of quoted properties in strings"\n}\n```\n\nThis line is responsible for iterating over the string and checking each character, but it doesn\'t account for quoted properties.\n\nThe second one is related to the unit test case you provided. It seems that there\'s an issue with the `testQuotedProps` function when it comes to converting quoted properties (strings) into dotted properties.\n\nHere\'s a new JSON object for this:\n\n```\n{\n  "lineNumber": 197,\n  "codeContent": "for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {",\n  "reason": "Inadequate handling of quoted properties in strings during property name conversion"\n}\n```\n\nThis line is responsible for iterating over the string and checking each character, but it doesn\'t account for quoted properties when converting them into dotted properties.\n\nThese new JSON objects should be added to the \'faultLocalization\' array, which now contains five JSON objects in descending order of suspicion.'}]
