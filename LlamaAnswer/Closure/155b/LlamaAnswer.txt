Adding variables to `staleVars` without a clear condition (line 215).\n3. Not checking if the initializing reference is null or empty before trying to get its assigned value (line 212).\n4. Not checking if the variable is a constant before trying to inline it (line 211).\n5. Skipping variables that were not collected or have already been inlined without further conditions (line 207).\n\nNote: The ordering of suspicion is subjective and based on the analysis provided.
