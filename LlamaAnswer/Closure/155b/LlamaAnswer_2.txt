This may lead to incorrect results or performance issues.\n2. **Invalid value retrieval**: In lines 213 and 212, `getAssignedValue()` is called on an unknown object (`init`). If this method returns null or an invalid value, it will lead to incorrect inlining results.\n3. **NullPointerException**: In line 211, `getInitializingReferenceForConstants()` may return null, which would cause a NullPointerException when trying to access its methods.\n4. **Uninitialized variable**: In line 204, the `referenceInfo` variable is not checked for null before being used.

This could be because the variable was not initialized before it was referenced.\n* Inline heuristics failed for the second reference, and the variable `v` is not inlined (line 257). This could be because the second reference has a different context or properties than the first reference.\n* The variable `v` is not inlined due to missing initialization (line 266). This is similar to the first potential bug.\n* The alias candidate\'s alias is not inlined due to missing initialization (line 289). This could be because the alias was not initialized before it was referenced.\n* There is an incorrect calculation of the first reference after initialization (line 234).
