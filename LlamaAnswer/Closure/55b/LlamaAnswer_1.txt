The first object points to line 117, where the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method calls another method (`NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)`) that seems to be incomplete or incorrect.\n2. The second object points to line 116, where the method itself is defined. I\'ve highlighted a potential issue with naming consistency.\n\nPlease note that these are just potential issues and might not directly cause the error message provided. The actual bug might be in another part of the codebase, but based on the given information, this analysis provides some possible reasons for the unexpected behavior.'}]
