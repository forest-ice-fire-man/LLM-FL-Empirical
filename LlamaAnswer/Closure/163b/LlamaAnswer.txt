However, it does not check if `node` is null or undefined before performing the assignment. This could lead to a null reference exception if `node` is null.\n2. **Unsecured assignment of \'exprNode\' property**: The line `this.exprNode = node;` assigns the input `node` to `this.exprNode` without any validation or sanitization.

However, the original code snippet does not have any relation with this. Therefore, I focused exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt.\n\nThe error message suggests a difference in tree structures between expected and actual output.
