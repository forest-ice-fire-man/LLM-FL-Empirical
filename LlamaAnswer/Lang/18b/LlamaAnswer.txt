These locations are listed in descending order of suspicion.\n\t+ The first location (line 475) is flagged due to the use of a single-element array, which could lead to incorrect indexing or unexpected behavior.\n\t+ The next two locations (lines 476 and 477) are empty lines, but they are included for completeness.\n\t+ The fourth location (line 511) is flagged due to the use of a static instance, which could lead to tight coupling and reduced flexibility.\n\t+ The fifth location (line 515) is flagged due to the creation of a new object on each iteration, which could lead to performance issues or memory leaks if not handled properly.\n\t+ The sixth location (line 520) is flagged due to the use of a recursive function call, which could lead to stack overflow errors or unexpected behavior if the input is not properly validated.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and unit test case, I have analyzed the original code snippet that you provided in the first prompt.
