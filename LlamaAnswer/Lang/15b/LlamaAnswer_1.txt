At line 668, when dealing with widening from primitive to wrapper class, this might cause unexpected behavior if not handled properly.\n\t2. At line 661, when dealing with primitive-primitive assignment without handling widening, this might lead to incorrect type arguments being returned.\n\t3. At line 655, the function returns null if the input classes are not assignable, which might be a problem in certain scenarios.\n\t4. At lines 673 and 670, using ternary operators for initialization might make the code less readable. Creating copies of maps might also be unnecessary in some cases.\n* The issues are listed in descending order of suspicion, with the most critical ones first.\n\nNote that these potential issues are just suggestions based on a quick analysis and might not necessarily be actual problems in this specific implementation. A thorough review by a human expert is still necessary to ensure the code\'s correctness and reliability.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and unit test case, it appears that there is an issue with the `getTypeArguments` method in the `TypeUtils` class.
