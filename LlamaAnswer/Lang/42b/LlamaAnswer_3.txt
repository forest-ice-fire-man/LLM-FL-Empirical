The bug seems to be related to incorrect Unicode code point conversion.\n\nIn the given code snippet, the line `writer.write(Integer.toString(c, 10));` seems to be causing issues when dealing with high-unicode characters. This might be due to incorrect usage of `Integer.toString(c, 10)` which is not designed for Unicode code points greater than 0x7F.'}]
