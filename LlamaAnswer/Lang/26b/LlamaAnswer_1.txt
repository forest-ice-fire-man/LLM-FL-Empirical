Additionally, the method does not handle cases where the input `date` has an invalid or unsupported time zone, which could lead to incorrect date formatting (potential bug #7).\n\nThese potential bugs are listed in descending order of suspicion. The code snippet from the first prompt is analyzed exclusively, and no consideration is given to the unit test case.'}]
