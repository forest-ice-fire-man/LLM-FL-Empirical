These checks could be combined to reduce unnecessary overhead.\n3. **Optimizing length checks**: The code checks if the values and types arrays have the same length, but this check could be optimized to only occur when the lengths are different.\n4. **Duplicate detection**: The code checks for duplicates in the types array, but this check could be optimized to only occur when a duplicate is found.\n5. **Range field comparison**: The code checks if the last range field and the current loop range field are in order, but this check could be optimized to only occur when they are not in order.\n\nThese issues are potential problems that could be improved for better performance or readability.
