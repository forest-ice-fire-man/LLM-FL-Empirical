A more thorough analysis of the surrounding code and requirements would be necessary to confirm their validity.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and unit test case, I\'ve analyzed the code snippet from the first prompt to identify potential issues.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue seems to be with the formatting of negative time periods in the `Period` class. The unit test case `testFormatStandard_negative()` expects a specific output for various inputs, but the actual output is different.\n\nUpon reviewing the code snippet from the first prompt (lines 118-136), I notice that there\'s a method `print()` which formats the period according to the ISO 8601 standard. However, when printing negative time periods with millisecond values (like `Period.millis(-8)`), the output is incorrect.\n\n**Fault Localization**\n\nBased on this analysis, I\'ve identified a potential issue in the code snippet from the first prompt.
