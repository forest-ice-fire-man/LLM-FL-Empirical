This is causing an IllegalArgumentException in the DateTimeFormatter.parseDateTime() method. This issue seems unrelated to the original code snippet, but it\'s included for completeness.\n\nNote that the new addition (Line 2) focuses on a different part of the code, which was not explicitly mentioned in the first prompt.
