If any of these methods are buggy or fail, it can significantly impact the correctness of the overall function.\n2.  **Potential silent failures**: Methods like `iField.roundFloor` and `iZone.convertUTCToLocal` might not raise errors or exceptions if they encounter issues during execution. This can lead to silent failures that are difficult to identify and fix.\n3.  **Complex calculations**: The offset calculation in line 522 involves multiple steps, making it more prone to bugs due to the increased complexity.\n4.  **Return value dependencies**: The final result returned by this function depends on two operations: `getOffsetToAdd` (line 523) and the subtraction of an offset (line 525).
