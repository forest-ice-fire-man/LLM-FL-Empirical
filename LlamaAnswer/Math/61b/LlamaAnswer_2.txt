The issues are listed in descending order of suspicion.\n\n1. At line 97, there\'s a potential division by zero error when creating a NormalDistributionImpl object if p is negative.\n2. At line 95, an unhandled exception is thrown if p is not positive, which might be a design choice but could still be considered a bug depending on the context.\n3. The rest of the code seems clean and doesn\'t have any obvious issues.\n\nThe \'intentOfThisFunction\' field indicates that this function\'s purpose is to construct a Poisson distribution with given parameters.', 'answer2': 'Here\'s an updated JSON object with a new issue found:\n\n```\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "Constructs a Poisson distribution with given parameters",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 94,\n      "codeContent": "throw MathRuntimeException.createIllegalArgumentException(LocalizedFormats.NOT_POSITIVE_POISSON_MEAN, p);",\n      "reason": "Potential bug: Incorrect exception handling.
