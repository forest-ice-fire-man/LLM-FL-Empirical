The remaining locations highlight potential issues with bracketing intervals in the Brent\'s method algorithm. The code snippet from line 22 is still a suspect because it checks for `yInitial * yMin < 0`, which may not be sufficient to ensure the function is properly bracketed by the interval `[min, max]`.'}]
