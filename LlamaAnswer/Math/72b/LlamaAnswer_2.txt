Potential exception throwing for non-bracketing endpoints.\n2. Infinite recursion caused by repeated function calls with the same parameters.\n3. Modification of result objects without proper validation.\n\nThese issues are likely contributing to the error message and unit test case failures reported in the provided snippet.'}]
