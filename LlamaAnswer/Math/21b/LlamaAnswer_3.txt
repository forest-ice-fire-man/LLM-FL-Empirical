The objects are listed in descending order of suspicion, with the most suspicious ones at the top. Each object has three fields:\n\n*   `lineNumber`: The line number of the suspicious code.\n*   `codeContent`: The actual code that is being executed at this line.\n*   `reason`: A brief explanation of why this location is identified as potentially buggy.\n\nThe analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, and not the unit test case.'}]
