However, it always returns `false`, which might be an incorrect implementation.\n\n### Fault localization\n\nI have identified one potential bug in the code snippet.\n\n#### Line 183: public boolean isSupportUpperBoundInclusive() {184:return false;\n\n*   **LineNumber:** 183\n*   **CodeContent:** return false;\n*   **Reason:** The method always returns `false`, which may be an incorrect implementation. This could lead to incorrect results or behavior in the surrounding code.\n\nThe other lines of code (182 and below) seem to be part of the surrounding context, but they do not appear to contribute directly to the potential bug identified at line 183.'}]
