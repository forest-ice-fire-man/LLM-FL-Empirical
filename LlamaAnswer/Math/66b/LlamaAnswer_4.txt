This value seems very small and might lead to inefficient optimization.\n2. **High absolute accuracy value**: In line 46, the absolute accuracy is set to `1E-10`. This value is quite high and may result in excessive computation time for large-scale optimizations.\n3. **Relatively low maximum iteration count**: In line 45, the maximum iteration count is set to 100. A relatively low value might lead to premature convergence or stagnation.\n4. **Maximum evaluations set to maximum possible integer value**: In line 44, the maximum evaluations are set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This may result in excessive memory usage or performance issues.\n\nThese potential bugs were identified by analyzing the code and considering factors such as optimization efficiency, computational complexity, and memory usage.
