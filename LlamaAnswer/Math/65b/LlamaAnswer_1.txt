This line seems to be the most suspicious due to its critical role in calculating the Chi-Square value.\n  - Line 257: An IndexOutOfBoundsException can occur if \'i\' exceeds the bounds of the \'residuals\' array. However, this error would not affect the calculation of the Chi-Square value directly; it might lead to incorrect results or runtime exceptions in other parts of the code.\n  - Line 256: A Potential IndexOutOfBoundsException can occur if \'rows\' is less than or equal to zero.
