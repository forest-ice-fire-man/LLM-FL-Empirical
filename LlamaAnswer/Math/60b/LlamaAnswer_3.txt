However, please note that without more context or information about the actual functionality and requirements of the code, these points are speculative and may not necessarily be bugs at all.', 'answer2': 'Here is the updated JSON object with the fault localization:\n\n```\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "Calculates the cumulative probability for a given value x, using the error function Erf.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 130,\n      "codeContent": "if (x < (mean - 20 * standardDeviation)) {",\n      "reason": "The condition inside this if statement is suspicious because it suggests a hard-coded value for the mean minus 20 times the standard deviation.

The first two items point out potential bugs in the logic of the function, while the last item suggests an improvement to the calculation of the upper tail.'}]
