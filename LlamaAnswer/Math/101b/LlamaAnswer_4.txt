It should handle this situation more robustly.\n*   At line 369: When parsing the imaginary part fails, the function sets the index back to initial and returns null without giving any indication of what went wrong. The function could provide a better error handling mechanism for such cases.\n*   At line 380: When the sequence of characters for the imaginary part is incorrect, the function sets the index back to initial and returns null. It would be more helpful if the function provided some feedback about the incorrect sequence encountered.\n*   At line 355: This case occurs when encountering an invalid sign character. Similar to the previous point, it should handle this situation better instead of returning null without a meaningful message.\n\nThe code appears generally correct in terms of its intent and overall structure for parsing complex numbers from strings, with some opportunities for improvement regarding error handling and robustness.'}]
