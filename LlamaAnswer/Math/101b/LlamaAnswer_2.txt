The reasons for each bug include:\n\n1. Setting the index to an initial value when encountering invalid characters or numbers, which could lead to incorrect parsing or loss of data.\n2. Returning null instead of throwing an exception when encountering invalid signs or imaginary characters, which could lead to unexpected behavior in calling code.\n3. Setting the error index to an incorrect value (startIndex) instead of endIndex, which could lead to incorrect reporting of parsing errors.\n\nThese potential bugs can be addressed by revising the code to throw exceptions or report errors correctly when encountering invalid inputs.'}]
