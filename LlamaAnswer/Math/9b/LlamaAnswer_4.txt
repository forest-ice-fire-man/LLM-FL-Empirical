This could potentially lead to issues if `zero` is not properly initialized or is of a different type than expected.\n\n2. **Method signature clarity (line 86)**: While the code snippet itself appears correct, there might be room for improvement in documenting what the `revert()` method does and under which conditions it\'s called.

This could lead to unexpected results or errors in certain scenarios.\n\n2. **Unclear variable type and initialization (line 87)**: As mentioned earlier, the expression `zero.subtract(direction)` uses an instance method (`subtract`) on an object named `zero`, which is not defined within this function. This unclear variable type and initialization might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n3. **Method signature clarity (line 86)**: While the code snippet itself appears correct, there might be room for improvement in documenting what the `revert()` method does and under which conditions it\'s called.
