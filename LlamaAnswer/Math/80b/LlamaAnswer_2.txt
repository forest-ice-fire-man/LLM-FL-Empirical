The \'lineNumber\', \'codeContent\', and \'reason\' fields provide more context about the suspected issues.\n\n**Additional Analysis:**\n\nBased on the provided unit test case, it seems like there might be an issue with the expected reference values (refEigenValues) or the computed eigenvalues using the given function. However, this is not directly related to the code snippet from the first prompt and should not affect the JSON object returned.\n\nThe analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt, and any potential bugs are added to the \'faultLocalization\' array in descending order of suspicion.'}]
