The error message suggests that an exception should be thrown but isn\'t, which might indicate a bug in the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class.\n\nThe code snippet provided from the first prompt is just a simple return statement, which seems to be fine on its own. But based on the context of the unit test case and the error message, it\'s likely that the real issue lies elsewhere in the codebase.'}]
