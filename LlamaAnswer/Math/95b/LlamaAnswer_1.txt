Inconsistent calculation approach (commented out)\n2. Unclear method behavior (`getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()` )\n3. Division by zero risk in the `initialDomainValue` function\n4. Non-standard naming convention for mathematical functions (`initialDomainValue`)\n5. Potential precision issues due to floating-point arithmetic'}]
