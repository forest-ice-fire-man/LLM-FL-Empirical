At line number 349: Commented-out code, which might be relevant in certain edge cases but is currently ignored.\n4.

At line number 357: Potential bug due to the possibility of \'coefficients\' being empty or null.\n\nThe \'faultLocalization\' array contains these potential issues in descending order of suspicion based on best practices and common pitfalls.
