The unit test case is not taken into account in this analysis.\n\nIn the context of the provided error message, it\'s possible that the precision issue is caused by a combination of factors, including:\n\n*   The subtraction operation in line 354\n*   The use of `Double.MIN_VALUE` to initialize `mostNegative`\n*   The size of the constraint matrix and number of constraints\n\nHowever, without further information or context, it\'s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the precision issue.'}]
