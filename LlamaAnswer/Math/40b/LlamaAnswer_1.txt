This function is not shown in the original code snippet, but its usage suggests that it may be responsible for the TooManyEvaluationsException. To provide a more accurate analysis, please provide the implementation of the `guessX` function.\n\nAdditionally, I\'ve identified potential issues with the `inverse_polynomial_interpolation` method itself:\n\n1.  **Potential NaN issue**: When using inverse polynomial interpolation with sparse sampling points (e.g., when `tmpX` is not defined), the `guessX` function might return a NaN value.\n2.  **Division by zero error**: When computing `start` or `end`, there\'s a potential division by zero error if either of these variables becomes zero.\n3.  **Overflow issue**: When incrementing `start` past its maximum value, an overflow might occur.\n4.  **Infinite loop detection**: To prevent unbounded iterations in the while-loop condition, you should check if `Double.isNaN(nextX)` remains true throughout the iteration process.\n5.  **Loss of precision**: When computing a bisection estimate for `nextX`, there\'s a potential loss of precision due to floating-point arithmetic.\n6.  **Integer overflow issue**: When subtracting `start` from `signChangeIndex`, an integer overflow might occur.\n\nPlease review the implementation of your code and address these potential issues to ensure the correctness and robustness of your solution.'}]
