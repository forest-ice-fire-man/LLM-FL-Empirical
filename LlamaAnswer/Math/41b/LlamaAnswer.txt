(This one is marked as low suspicion because it\'s the same issue as above.)\n* Line 513: Possible out-of-bounds error when iterating over the values array, but this would likely be caught by the JVM.\n* Line 520: Possible NullPointerException if the weights array is null.\n* Line 506: Unclear intention of the test() function. What does it do?'}]
