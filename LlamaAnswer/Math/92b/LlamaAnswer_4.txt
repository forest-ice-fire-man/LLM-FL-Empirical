The exception thrown when the result is too large is not handled well.\n2. There\'s a potential overflow issue in line 204 where integers are multiplied together.\n3. `Math.round` might truncate the result instead of rounding it, which could lead to incorrect results for certain values of n and k.\n4. It\'s unclear what happens when the numerator or denominator overflows in the formula used.\n5. The code uses recursion, which can be inefficient for large inputs.\n\nNote that these potential bugs are not necessarily actual bugs, but rather areas where the code might need improvement or additional consideration.', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and unit test case, I have analyzed the code snippet for potential bugs.
