This might indicate a missing implementation or a bug in parameter handling. (Reason: "The method is not using any of the provided parameters...")\n\t+ The method declaration on line 142 does not check if the provided function and goal type are valid or compatible, which might lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions when using this method. (Reason: "The method is not checking...")\n\nNote that these bugs are speculative and may not be actual issues in the code. A more thorough analysis would require additional context and information about the code\'s purpose and requirements.', 'answer2': 'I\'ve re-analyzed the code snippet you provided earlier.
