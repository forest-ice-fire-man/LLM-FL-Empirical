In line 359, `System.arraycopy()` might not be thread-safe, which could lead to concurrency issues.\n2. In line 368, the `computeDerivatives()` method might not handle edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect results.\n3. In lines 371 and 395, event handler step acceptance and stop conditions might lead to infinite loops if not implemented carefully.\n4. In line 372, setting the reset flag unnecessarily might lead to incorrect results.\n5. In line 395, the OR operation on boolean values might lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.\n\nPlease note that these are just potential bugs based on my analysis and might not be actual issues in this specific code snippet.', 'answer2': 'After analyzing the provided error message and unit test case, I have identified potential issues with the `DormandPrince853Integrator` class.
