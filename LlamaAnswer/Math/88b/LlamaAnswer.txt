These locations are identified as potentially buggy based on the provided error message and unit test case. The analysis focuses exclusively on the code snippet from the first prompt.\n\nPlease note that the line numbers in the \'faultLocalization\' array might not match the actual line numbers in your code, but rather reflect the order of suspicion.'}]
