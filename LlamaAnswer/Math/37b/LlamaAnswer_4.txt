When dealing with very large or small input values (like the ones used in the `testTan()` method), the method fails to produce accurate results due to numerical instability. Specifically:\n\n1.  The use of `double` variables and operations can lead to precision issues when handling large numbers.\n2.

This could lead to incorrect results or even crashes.\n2. **Incorrect scaling in the calculation of \'real2\' and \'imaginary2\'**: The code scales both the real and imaginary parts by a factor of 2, but it\'s not clear if this is the intended behavior. If the intention was to scale one part by a different factor, this could lead to incorrect results.\n3. **Undefined variable \'isNaN\'**: The `if` statement at line 1065 uses an undefined variable \'isNaN\', which makes its purpose unclear. This could be a simple typo or a more significant issue depending on the context.\n4. **Division-by-zero exception in the return statement**: In the return statement, there\'s a division by \'d\', which may become zero if `FastMath.cosh(real2) + FastMath.cos(imaginary2)` is zero.
