If this condition is true, it may indicate that there are invalid data in the dataset, leading to potential division-by-zero errors.\n* On lines 275 and 290, the code accesses `dataset.getMeanValue(row, column)` when `value >= uclip`. This can lead to out-of-bounds access if the value of `column` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the dataset.\n* On line 281, the code sets `value = lclip;`, which may result in loss of precision if `value` is very close to `lclip`.\n* On lines 299 and 300, the code calculates `rectX` by taking the minimum of `transY2` and `transY1`. If these values have different signs, it can lead to overflow or underflow.\n* Note that there are no more than five potential bugs identified in this analysis.
