The check for exceeding the maximum item count can throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the series is empty.\n2. Adding an item at a negative index (when `this.autoSort` is true) can lead to IndexOutOfBoundsException if the series has no items or only one item.\n\nThese bugs are likely responsible for the error message shown in the unit test case \'testBug1955483\'.'}]
