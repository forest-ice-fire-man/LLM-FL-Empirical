Specifically, the `title` attribute in the generated HTML tag has an extra space character when it shouldn\'t be present.\n\nHere\'s the problematic line:\n```\n64:public String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n65:return " title=\\"" + toolTipText\n66:+ "\\" alt=\\"\\"";\n```\n\nThe issue is likely due to the fact that `toolTipText` contains a newline character (`\\n`) or a carriage return (`\\r`) when it shouldn\'t. This causes the generated HTML tag to have an extra space character in the `title` attribute.\n\nHere\'s the updated JSON object:\n```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function is intended to generate a tooltip fragment for a UI component.",\n  "faultLocalization": [\n    {\n      "lineNumber": 66,\n      "codeContent": "+ \\" alt=\\"\\"",\n      "reason": "Potential bug: This line of code seems to be appending an empty string without any explanation.
