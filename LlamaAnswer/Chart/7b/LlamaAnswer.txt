The if-else conditions seem to be correctly updating the corresponding indices based on the given period and index.\n\nIf you would like me to analyze the code again or provide a different analysis, please let me know!', 'answer2': 'Based on the provided error message and unit test case, I will analyze the code snippet again.\n\nAfter re-examining the code snippet, I noticed that it is related to updating the bounds of time periods based on given index and period.
