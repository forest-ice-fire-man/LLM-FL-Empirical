Instead, consider removing the mock from the set and iterating over it again.\n\n3. **Potential Concurrent Modification Exception**: When modifying the `mocks` set while iterating over it using an Iterator, a `ConcurrentModificationException` may be thrown. To avoid this, consider converting the Iterator to a List before making modifications.\n\n4. **No Handling for `null` instance**: In line 114, the function calls `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, instance).thenInject()`, which can throw an exception if `instance` is null.
