This directly relates to the concerns about the handling of various Node types in the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` function.\n2. **Suspicion Order**: The order of entries in the `faultLocalization` array reflects the most suspicious lines of code based on the potential connection between the error message and the functionality of the code snippet. The return statement was prioritized as it is directly related to the function\'s validation logic.'}]
