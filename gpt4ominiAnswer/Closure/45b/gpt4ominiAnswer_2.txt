Each entry describes the line number, the code present, and a rationale for why each line can be problematic, emphasizing the risks related to null node references and assumptions about node structure. \n\nThis updated JSON object reflects the intent of the original function, its usage context, and the specific areas of concern based on the error message and the operation of the provided function.'}]
