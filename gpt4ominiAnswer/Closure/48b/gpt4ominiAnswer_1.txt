The provided code snippet does not appear to adequately enforce checks regarding the number of arguments, which ties into the potential shortcomings identified in the fault localization. \n- The identified suspicious lines reflect issues that could lead to runtime errors and affect the overall behavior of type checking, particularly under dynamic conditions in JavaScript. \n- The overall intent of the function is validated against the context of the test to ensure that argument expectations are set up correctly and that types are properly inferred.'}]
