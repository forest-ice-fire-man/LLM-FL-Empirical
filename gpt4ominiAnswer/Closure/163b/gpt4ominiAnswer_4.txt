original code snippet, which lacks input validation for the parameters. \n- The lines of code are assessed for risks that could lead to runtime errors if invalid arguments are provided. \n- The reasoning indicates that both the `node` and `module` parameters need to be checked for valid types before assignment, as this lack of validation can generate difficult-to-debug errors that may manifest during functional testing or runtime execution.'}, {'answer1': '```json\n{\n  "intentOfThisFunction": "This function is intended to create a LiteralProperty object by initializing its
