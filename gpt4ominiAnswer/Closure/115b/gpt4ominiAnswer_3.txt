Each issue is grounded in specific concerns regarding potential null references and side effect evaluations, which could lead to the errors observed in the test case.\n2. The reasons for each identified issue reflect the logical flow of the code and its handling of the call and function nodes, emphasizing how these locations could generate discrepancies in expected inline output versus actual output.'}]
